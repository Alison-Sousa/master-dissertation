	abstract = {Amid growing concerns about climate change and fossil fuel depletion, the global shift toward sustainable energy has become increasingly urgent. Despite significant investments in renewable energy (RE), there remains a large gap in meeting global sustainability targets. This study is the first to analyze the key factors driving RE investments, using a comprehensive panel dataset of 36 countries over 21 years (2000–2020), comparing developed and developing/emerging nations. The results show that in developed countries, factors like industrial growth, environmental taxes, social globalization, and climate vulnerability drive RE investments, while inflation and political instability hinder progress. In contrast, developing countries benefit from environmental taxes, social globalization, environmental technologies, and climate vulnerability, but industrial growth and oil prices negatively impact RE investments. These differences underscore the need for tailored strategies. Quantile-based assessments further highlight variations across countries, offering a nuanced understanding of the determinants of RE investments. This research provides valuable insights for policymakers, helping to shape more effective strategies to accelerate the transition to RE and meet sustainability goals worldwide. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Geopolitical tensions, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, ongoing Middle-Eastern wars, and the post-Cold War dynamics between the USA and Russia, have contributed to significant global political instability. These risks disrupt economic growth, destabilize energy supply chains, and foster economic uncertainty, often prioritizing energy security over environmental sustainability. Existing literature inadequately addresses how geopolitical risks interact with environmental sustainability, particularly within developed economies like Canada. To bridge this gap, this study examines the role of per capita income on environmental outcomes under the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) framework, explicitly incorporating geopolitical risks as a critical determinant. Using Canadian time series data spanning from 1980 to 2022, this research employs the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) estimation technique to explore short- and long-term cointegrating relationships among key variables, including economic growth, energy consumption, trade openness, foreign direct investment (FDI), ICT development, and financial development. The findings confirm the inverted U-shaped EKC hypothesis for Canada, indicating that economic growth initially exacerbates carbon emissions (CO<inf>2</inf>) before leading to environmental improvements at higher income levels. Geopolitical risks are found to positively contribute to CO<inf>2</inf> emissions, emphasizing their role as a barrier to achieving environmental sustainability. To validate robustness, the Kernel Regularized Least Squares (KRLS) machine learning approach is employed, confirming the consistency of results. Additionally, the Toda-Yamamoto causality test identifies directional causal relationships among the variables. Policy recommendations emphasize the need for Canada to implement targeted strategies that mitigate the impact of geopolitical risks on environmental outcomes. Specifically, the study advocates for: (1) diversifying energy sources to reduce reliance on geopolitically sensitive regions, (2) investing in renewable energy technologies to ensure sustainable economic growth, and (3) enhancing trade policies to prioritize low-carbon technologies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Youth unemployment, defined as individuals aged 15–29 actively seeking but unable to find work, is a pressing socio-economic and political issue in the Gurage Zone of Central Ethiopia. This study aims to examine the multifaceted consequences of youth unemployment as perceived by various stakeholders, including policymakers, community leaders, and employers, and provide evidence-based recommendations. A mixed-methods approach was employed, integrating both quantitative and qualitative data. A total of 400 participants were selected through multi-stage sampling. Data collection involved structured questionnaires, key informant interviews, and focus group discussions. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) via AMOS software, while qualitative data were analyzed through thematic analysis. The findings indicate that youth unemployment has profound social, economic, and political impacts. Socially, it is linked to increased poverty, crime, social exclusion, and mental health issues. Economically, it results in reduced household income, rural-to-urban migration, declining tax revenues, and diminished consumer demand. Politically, it fosters dissatisfaction with governance, social unrest, and reduced political engagement among youth. To address these issues, the study recommends aligning educational curricula with labor market needs, expanding vocational training, and fostering industry-academia partnerships. Additionally, promoting youth entrepreneurship through microfinance, tax incentives, and business incubators is vital. Strengthening investments in labor-intensive sectors like agriculture and irrigation, alongside improving governance and social support systems, is essential for mitigating the effects of youth unemployment and promoting sustainable development. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

They must respond strategically to remain competitive. In this systematic literature review, we propose a novel way to analyse risks, along geographical and temporal dimensions. We synthesize findings from 111 empirical peer-reviewed articles to identify how and why MNEs adopt nonmarket strategies (NMS) in contexts where risks prevail. Our findings show MNEs combine adaptive, additive and transformative strategies to address ongoing risks, but focus on adaptive approaches when faced with abrupt challenges. The distinction applies across geographic dimensions, with a tendency for firms to adopt embedded-oriented NMS for within-country SPRs, and cross-border balancing-oriented NMS to respond to cross-country SPRs. We contribute to the literature by enhancing conceptualization of SPRs and offering a comprehensive understanding on the types and effectiveness of NMS used by firms to address political and social risks. Our review enhances theory by proposing an integrated conceptual framework and directions to guide future research. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Exploring how Islamic banks contribute to poverty reduction, an area previously given little attention, extends the examination of the direct influence that credit and savings have on poverty alleviation. We argue that financial technology (fintech) can be a vital moderating factor in the relationship between Islamic banks’ total assets and poverty alleviation efforts. We employed three scenarios of regression analysis, namely, direct, moderation, and marginal effects, in examining balanced panel data from Islamic banks operating in developing countries from 2014 to 2020. Our analysis accounted for various factors such as economic growth, political instability, and legal origin. Our findings reveal a significantly negative correlation between total assets held by Islamic banks and the poverty rate within each country. We observed that using fintech, particularly the technology adoption index among the population, moderated this relationship. Conversely, although a robust and stable economy positively affected poverty reduction, legal origin did not directly influence this outcome. These results underscore the importance of integrating advancements in fintech into poverty alleviation strategies, particularly for policymakers in developing countries. Our study contributes original insights by comprehensively examining pertinent variables within the context of empirical research. We anticipate that our findings will resonate with scholars and policymakers in finance, economics, and development studies, offering valuable guidance for initiatives that foster development, including those outlined in Saudi Arabia’s Hail development plans. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Supplier firms in the Global South face compounded risks from political instability that challenge their ability to maintain participation in global value chains (GVCs). While resilience is increasingly acknowledged as a critical capability, it remains unclear how suppliers develop resilience when conventional GVC governance strategies, often grounded in institutional stability, prove insufficient. This gap is especially pronounced in knowledge-intensive service sectors like software development, where codification, coordination, and inter-firm trust are central but often disrupted by political instability. This study examines the resilience of GVC suppliers operating in politically unstable regions of South Asia, particularly India and Pakistan. It focuses on the role of governance mechanisms—such as codification, managing complexity, and supplier capabilities, on supplier resilience. It also investigates how trust moderates these relationships. Drawing on Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) and the Dynamic Capabilities View (DCV), we argue that these governance mechanisms function not only as efficiency enablers but also as dynamic governance adaptations that suppliers actively mobilize to survive and adapt. A quantitative analysis using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was conducted on survey data collected from 100 software firms. The results show that task codification and management of task complexity enhance supplier resilience. It further reveals that trust negatively affects the links between task codification and resilience, challenging the conventional assumption that trust uniformly strengthens GVC relationships. The core theoretical contribution of this study lies in extending TCE and DCV by showing how resilience is enabled through external governance adaptation and by rethinking trust as a conditional, context-dependent mechanism rather than a universal good. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The geographic locus of this paper is the Caribbean region, mainly focusing on the island tax havens that had been part of the British empire prior to decolonization. The article examines the relationship between the development of tax havens and decolonisation, and explores questions of international capital movement, the institutional structure of tax havens, the development of banking and commercial services in tax havens, and other offshore business activities. The article presents new data on international capital investment and capital movement, and provides empirical evidence in relation to the structure and function of businesses located in tax havens. This evidence is used to engage with emerging debates with reference to the history of tax havens: specifically, the nature of capital movement and the importance of beneficial ownership rights, and the relationship between the (re)location of business to tax havens and the mitigation of political risk and instability. We demonstrate that the development of tax havens in this period was a consequence of substantial innovation by business and finance to create advantageous environmental conditions in relation to taxation and governance. This was supported by an isomorphic process that spread similarly favourable regimes of law and regulation between different tax havens, as well as the development of a range of supportive commercial and financial services. We conclude by discussing the implications for future research on this topic. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The Reformation expanded social welfare, but provided it in a particularistic way to “deserving" poor and natives only. This gave Protestantism an ambiguous character in terms of redistribution and its impact on inequality. I develop a theoretical framework of this trade-off between welfare expansion and particularistic provision, and test its implications empirically, using a difference-in-differences and an instrumental variable strategy. In line with the theoretical framework, the analysis documents that the Reformation exacerbated inequality overall by making marginal poor people relatively poorer. This increase in inequality was driven by the introduction of new particularistic poor relief policies in Protestant communities. Economic growth was unlikely to be large enough to compensate poor strata for their losses. Protestantism emerges as an underappreciated driver of preindustrial inequality, long before the onset of industrialisation and modern economic growth. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The purpose is to identify the channels through which mobilizations—anti-austerity protests, general strikes, youth actions, and solidarity networks—interacted with the economy. The main hypothesis is that social protest operates as an economic force via three mechanisms: expectations (shifts in household and firm beliefs affecting consumption, confidence, and investment), disruption (coordination and operating costs from strikes and stoppages affecting output and employment), and institutional feedback (policy sequencing and credibility under EU–IMF conditionality shaping behavior). Using a theoretical, literature-based methodology—a structured narrative review of peer-reviewed studies, policy documents, and historical syntheses—we map these mechanisms onto outcomes (GDP, unemployment, investment, consumer confidence). The findings support the hypothesis: expectations and feedback dominate the transmission to investment and confidence, while repeated disruption is most salient for labor-market dynamics; solidarity infrastructures cushion social costs but have ambiguous aggregate effects. The scope is interpretive and Greece-specific, yielding testable propositions for future causal work. Limitations follow from the design: the study does not estimate effect sizes or establish causality; conclusions are analytically persuasive rather than statistically demonstrative. The contribution is a mechanism map that integrates social-movement theory with crisis political economy and clarifies where empirical identification should focus. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Understanding this relationship is crucial, as the transition to renewable energy is essential for sustainable development, yet it may be undermined by political instability and violent conflict. The study employs a dynamic spatial econometric approach to capture both spatial and temporal effects of armed conflicts on renewable energy use. Using the dynamic spatial Durbin model, the findings reveal that armed conflicts exert a significant negative influence on renewable energy consumption. The estimated impact is 18.76 % in the dynamic model, compared to 17.58 % in the non-dynamic model. Spatial spillover effects suggest that armed conflicts, through contagion and diffusion mechanisms, negatively affect renewable energy consumption in neighboring countries by approximately 14 %. Both short and long term effects are generally negative and statistically significant. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that terrorism has a more pronounced effect than other types of conflict. Additionally, the impact of armed conflicts is stronger in the Sahel region than in the rest of the sample.

The findings reveal that while gross capital formation is a significant growth driver, financial development has no meaningful impact. Notably, intermediate education contributes positively to growth, whereas advanced education surprisingly shows a negative effect. Additionally, the results indicate a direct relationship between renewable energy consumption and growth, with oil consumption having a negative impact.

	abstract = {The phenomenon of resource curse refers to the effect of the availability of a region in its natural resources. This is a special concern for oil-producing countries. The paradox of the resource curse indicates that countries with abundant natural resources are experiencing conditions of sluggish economic growth, social inequality and political instability. This study aims to analyze the dynamic relationship between oil production, the amount of oil reserves, and oil prices to GDP. The researcher analyzed in the short and long term the 4 largest oil-producing countries in the Middle East region, namely Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait. Empirically, the time series data used covers the years 2013-2023 using the VECM Panel method. The results of the estimate show that there is no causal relationship, only the variable of oil reserves affects economic growth. Based on the Impulse Response Function (IRF), it shows that economic growth responds to shocks that occur on itself or two other variables, namely experiencing fluctuations at the beginning of the period and reaching equilibrium points in different periods. The results of the Variance Decomposition (VD) contribution show that oil production has a negative relationship with economic growth. The long-term results of PVECM found that oil reserves (CM) and oil production (PM) in lag 1 did not have a significant influence on economic growth. As well as the short-term results of PVECM that oil reserves (CM) have a significant influence on economic growth, while oil production (PM) does not have a significant influence in the short term. This discovery provides an interesting picture of the dynamics of natural resources, especially oil, in relation to economic growth. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Income inequality remains a critical challenge globally, with developing nations experiencing the most severe disparities. In fragile states like Somalia, climate change and political instability exacerbate economic inequality, limiting opportunities and deepening structural inequities. This study empirically examines the impact of climate change, political stability, and macroeconomic variables—including GDP per capita, inflation, population growth, and urbanization—on income inequality in Somalia from 1980 to 2022. Using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model and Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS), the study explores both short-run and long-run dynamics. The findings reveal that in the long run, rising temperatures significantly increase income inequality, while GDP per capita growth reduces disparities. Political stability, though beneficial for economic growth, is associated with widening inequality, suggesting that economic gains during stable periods are not evenly distributed. Population growth exacerbates income inequality, while inflation and urbanization show no significant long-run effects. In the short run, rainfall increases inequality, while short-term temperature fluctuations temporarily reduce disparities due to seasonal labor demand. The error correction term confirms a stable long-run relationship, with approximately 36.8% of disequilibrium corrected annually. FMOLS results reinforce the robustness of these findings, emphasizing climate factors and economic growth as key determinants of inequality. These findings highlight the need for policies that mitigate climate-induced inequality, promote equitable wealth distribution, and ensure inclusive economic growth. Strengthening climate adaptation, expanding financial inclusion, stabilizing inflation, and supporting rural development are essential to fostering long-term economic equity in Somalia. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Utilizing a dynamic panel data approach with the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator, we assess how these risks influence various indicators of energy security and renewable energy investment across 36 developing countries from 1990 to 2022. Our empirical findings reveal that reducing political and financial risks enhances energy security and facilitates the transition to renewable energy sources. Lower political risk creates a stable environment conducive to long-term investments in the energy sector, while reduced financial risk lowers the cost of capital, making large-scale energy projects more feasible. The interaction of these risks fosters investor confidence, attracts foreign direct investment, and promotes innovation and competition within the energy sector. Additionally, GDP growth and trade openness positively impact ES and REA by providing financial resources and enabling the exchange of advanced technologies. However, high human capital levels may increase energy consumption due to greater economic activity and higher living standards, posing challenges to energy security and the renewable transition. These insights offer valuable policy recommendations for enhancing energy security and promoting sustainable energy transitions in politically and financially volatile environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Georgia’s strategic location between Europe and Asia makes it a key destination for foreign direct investment (FDI). Since independence, the country has implemented economic reforms to enhance its business environment, including regulatory improvements, anti-corruption measures, and trade liberalization. Despite these efforts, Georgia faces political, economic, and social volatility, impacting investment decisions by multinational enterprises (MNEs). Political instability, including frequent government changes and regional tensions, creates uncertainty. Economic fluctuations in GDP growth, inflation, and exchange rates further complicate investment, while labour market concerns and social unrest add additional risks. Volatility can deter investment by increasing perceived risks, yet it also presents opportunities for MNEs adept at navigating uncertain environments. This study examines the relationship between Georgia’s instability and MNE investment strategies, focusing on how political, economic, and social factors shape the investment climate. Political shifts influence regulatory frameworks, economic volatility affects profitability, and social instability impacts labour costs and operational efficiency. By analyzing macroeconomic data, political stability, and market conditions, this research explores how MNEs perceive and respond to risk in Georgia. It assesses volatility’s sectoral impact and long-term consequences on FDI inflows, outflows, and distribution. The study contributes to international business literature by clarifying how volatility affects investment in emerging markets. It also offers recommendations for policymakers to enhance Georgia’s investment appeal and for MNEs to develop effective risk mitigation strategies. Combining theoretical insights with empirical data, this research provides a nuanced understanding of volatility’s role in shaping FDI dynamics. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Moreover, we investigate whether firm-level political and non-political risks influence the propensity to delay or expedite the exit/withdrawal process. Contrary to utilitarian expectations advocating for ethical exit decisions irrespective of exposure and risks, firms with higher Russian exposure were less likely to exit sooner, indicating a prioritization of business interests over ethical imperatives. This self-interest effect was further amplified by heightened political risks but attenuated by non-political risks. These findings remained consistent across various model specifications, with limited discernible variations based on firm characteristics such as ranking, COVID-19 exposure and risk, past idiosyncratic volatility, or family ownership and control. In addition, an examination of post-exit effects on profitability, risk, cost of capital, and liquidity revealed no statistically significant relationships.

We use a comprehensive firm-level sample of 37 countries from 2002 to 2022 (42,587 firm years). Utilizing risk management and financial resilience theory, we define ESG as a dynamic, responsive mechanism by which corporations alleviate undiversifiable shocks. Utilizing a lead-lag autoregressive methodology on a cross-country firm-level panel, we demonstrate that ESG participation escalates in reaction to increasing risk levels; however, it exhibits systematic variation based on firm ESG maturity, industry attributes, and risk categories. Companies with inferior ESG scores have a more pronounced reaction to political instability, whereas those with superior ESG performance respond more acutely to geopolitical upheavals. Significantly, we reveal varied reactions across ESG pillars: environmental performance typically declines under geopolitical stress, whereas social and governance aspects frequently remain stable or enhance, indicating short-term adaptive tactics. Sectoral elements, like energy intensity and competitive pressure, further influence ESG reactions. Our findings provide fresh insights into the environmental management consequences of systemic risk exposure, emphasizing the necessity for supportive legislative frameworks and risk-sensitive ESG structures.

Prior research offers mixed evidence on which measure—cash flows or earnings—has greater predictive value. Using a panel of twelve industrial firms listed on the Palestine Exchange (PEX) from 2014 to 2021, this study moves beyond conventional linear models by applying a non-linear machine learning method, specifically the Boosted Tree model in JMP. The results show that while the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) provided statistically insignificant outcomes, the Boosted Tree model exhibited strong predictive power. This indicates that both past earnings and cash flows can be effective predictors when used within a flexible, adaptive modeling framework. These findings highlight the importance of methodological innovation, especially in emerging markets like Palestine, where financial limitations, weak institutional structures, and political instability are prevalent. By introducing Boosted Tree modeling, this study contrib-utes a valuable forecasting approach for data-constrained and complex environments.

	abstract = {This paper aims to show the role of institutional factors in the growth of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). SMEs are a vital segment of the world economy that contributes to employment growth and economic growth. According to research, prosperous SMEs frequently make strategic use of both formal and informal institutions, operating in compliance with the law and utilizing social networks and local expertise. Designing policies that promote the expansion of SMEs sustainably and increase their economic resilience requires an understanding of the influence of formal and informal institutions. The growth of SMEs of 86 firms for a total of 11 years was taken as a dependent variable. While formal (Tax Rate, Tax Administration, Doing Business, Customs Barriers) and informal (Corruption, Political Instability, and Judicial Obstacles) were taken as independent variables. The total number of observations is 946. As an econometric model, it is a panel data linear regression model. In conclusion, the statistically significant variables are; tax rate, tax administration, customs barriers, and corruption, while the variables that were not significant. Tax Rate, Tax Administration, and Corruption have positive impact on SME firm growth, while Custom Barriers have negative impact on SME firm growth. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This study uses the strategy tripod view theory to develop a novel theoretical model to explain how perceived political instability and informal competition impact the relationship between foreign technologies and product innovation. Our empirical model, which is based on survey and national-level data from thousands of firms across several emerging markets, shows that (i) low levels of perceived political instability and increased foreign technologies marginally increase the chances of introducing new products or services. (ii) Low levels of informal competition and high levels of foreign technologies marginally increase product innovation. (iii) High levels of perceived political instability and informal competition marginally reduce the likelihood of product innovation. (iv) The interaction between perceived political instability, informal competition, and foreign technologies marginally increases firms’ product innovation.

The study identifies FDI as a critical driver for restoring economic stability and fostering sustainable development in Ukraine, particularly in light of the extensive destruction caused by the ongoing war. The aim of the paper is to investigate the role of foreign direct investment in economic recovery and war-affected infrastructure reconstruction in Ukraine for sustainable development. The methodology involves a multidimensional approach, incorporating quantitative analysis of FDI inflows and outflows from 2013 to 2023 in Ukraine, regulatory framework examination, correlation and regression analyses to identify key factors influencing FDI dynamics, forecasting and others. By analyzing, forecasting and comparing Ukraine’s FDI trends with selected European countries, particularly in the context of geopolitical challenges and economic instability, the study provides a thorough understanding of the unique barriers and opportunities Ukraine faces in attracting FDI. The results reveal that FDI in Ukraine has been significantly influenced by political instability and the ongoing war, with inflows showing notable volatility. Despite these challenges, resilience in the economy has been demonstrated, driven by international financial support and domestic recovery efforts. The originality of this research lies in its focus on the specific context of post-war recovery in Ukraine, offering new insights into how FDI can serve as a catalyst for sustainable development. By identifying strategic areas for investment and addressing current legislative barriers, this study provides valuable contributions to the broader understanding of FDI’s role in post-war economic recovery. Further research is required to refine analyses of factors, develop predictive models and explore emerging FDI trends as geopolitical conditions evolve. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to study the effects of cultural distance and political risk on the Middle East international SMEs’ choice of entry mode to the foreign target markets relative to their resource commitment. The SMEs were studied from two countries the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Lebanon. The market entry could be either through non-equity entry modes (exports and contractual agreements) or equity entry modes (shared and full ownership/ control of foreign direct investments). The respondents of this study were owners and managers of UAE and Lebanese international SMEs. We obtained primary data through a survey using a semi-structured questionnaire. We studied the attitudes of SME owners and managers by using a quantitative method, statistically analyzing the responses using a one-sample T-test and the Spearman correlation coefficient. The findings show that when cultural distance is high between UAE/Lebanon and the host country, the SMEs tend to prefer less commitment in terms of financial resources. Therefore, the contingency approach suggests that high cultural distance leads investors to favor entry modes with greater flexibility, enabling easy dissolution in the event of failure. When looking at how political risk affected the choice of entry mode for UAE and Lebanon’s small and medium-sized businesses into international markets, it seemed that these businesses would rather commit fewer resources and limit their financial loss in case they fail. This supports the Transaction Cost Theory, which says that foreign investors are unwilling to commit many resources in a high political risk environment. In addition, the research findings confirm the contingency approach since both UAE and Lebanon SMEs tend to choose non-equity entry modes to have a flexible position to be able to dissolve their commitment when they face unfavorable changes in environmental conditions. Furthermore, the results show that UAE and Lebanon SMEs don’t seem to agree with choosing high-commitment full ownership/control FDI as an entry mode in a high-political-risk context. The originality of this research is its emphasis on UAE and Lebanon SMEs’ internationalization strategies and how these companies with limited resources could build on key success factors for developing their businesses in new markets. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The global construction industry has encountered record growth, especially following the COVID-19 pandemic period, during which the construction industry almost entirely ceased. However, the prices of building materials used by the construction sector have increased rapidly since the COVID-19 pandemic due to interruptions in the supply chain, causing increases in interest rates, inflation rates, and wage rates, as well as changes in tax rates. This has resulted in a contraction of construction activities in the euro area that warrants investigation. The purpose of this study was to empirically evaluate the impacts of political, economic, and financial risks on the cost of construction materials, which have caused a recession in the European economy. In this study, an empirical examination of the long-term equilibrium relationship between the construction cost index and various risk indices associated with politics, economics, and finance across Europe was conducted. This study also explored the construction-led growth hypothesis in the eurozone. Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLSs) and Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLSs) panel estimation techniques were employed here. The panel regression results were obtained using the FMOLS technique and provided statistically significant elasticity coefficients. The results revealed that the economic risk index was statistically significant at 1% with an elasticity coefficient of 0.242, whereas both the political risk index and the financial risk index had elasticity coefficients of 0.231 and 0.228 at the 10% significance level, respectively. The results of this study are robust and provide strong empirical evidence that these risk factors have negative impacts on the construction cost index within the EU area, which is in agreement with the related literature. The results of the DOLS estimation methodology were significant only at the 10% significance interval for financial and economic risk parameters, with elasticity values of 0.244 and 0.183, respectively. Moreover, the results of the Dumitrescu–Hurlin Panel Causality Test determined a significant bidirectional causal relationship between the construction cost index and the financial, economic, and political risk indices in Europe. This study ultimately validates the construction-led growth hypothesis for European nations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses secondary data from the World Bank and the Global State of Democracy Indices of 16 West African countries (WACs) over the period from 1989 to 2018. Fixed- and random-effects econometric regression models are used to assess the nexus between 12 macroeconomic indicators (including political risk and cultural factors) and FDI inflows into WACs. Findings: The critical drivers of FDI inflows into WACs are the richness of natural resources, market size or gross domestic product (GDP), imports and exports of goods and services, trade openness and the currency's strength as measured by the exchange rate. The result also reveals that French-speaking countries attract more FDI than other English-speaking countries. The previously cited determinants of FDI, such as infrastructural development, inflation, tax and political stability, are insignificant in determining FDI inflows into WACs. Originality/value: This study uncovers the critical drivers explaining the FDI inflows into WACs, where FDI accounts for 39% of external finance. The study's contribution is that Francophone WACs attract more FDI than Anglophone WACs. The most important drivers of FDI are abundant natural resources, GDP, imports, exports, trade openness and exchange rate. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the issue of increasing economic inequality in both advanced and emerging economies has garnered considerable focus, sparking numerous debates in economic and political circles. At the heart of social science inquiries is the critical question of whether economic inequality acts as a catalyst for or an obstacle to economic growth. This study explores the impact of wealth inequality on economic growth considering heterogeneity of the countries. Utilizing advanced datasets and cutting-edge machine learning techniques to address the nonlinear dynamics of this relationship, our analysis provides a nuanced departure from traditional panel data models. Our findings indicate that the impact of wealth inequality on economic growth is heterogeneous, contingent upon a country’s economic structure and existing level of inequality. Specifically, while a moderate level of inequality may stimulate growth in developed and pre-communist countries, it tends to impede growth in developing and underdeveloped countries with higher degrees of economic inequality. Our research further elucidates the presence of an inverted U-shaped relationship between wealth inequality and growth, identifying an optimal inequality threshold beyond which the adverse effects—such as diminished access to education and increased social unrest—surpass the potential benefits. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The study reveals exceptional resilience among Palestinian lawyers. A quantitative cross-sectional study was used; the goals of the study involved 323 participants from different places in Palestine. Data analysis employed Smart PLS4 to build a regression model. Challenging conventional notions, the study provides valuable insights for state strategies, legal firms, educational institutions, and policymakers to address challenges and improve lawyer retention and job satisfaction in an environment marked by unstable economic and political conditions. Additionally, it examines gender-specific career intentions, notably women lawyers displaying a stronger inclination to stay, potentially linked to socio-economic responsibilities. This study contributes significantly to existing literature by providing a unique case study on career continuance determinants within economic and political instability.

However, this is driven predominantly by the reduction of scope 2 emissions, which “involves purchased energy consumed by the firm.” With increasing policymakers, investors, and stakeholders' emphasis on positive climate change actions, our findings indicate that corporations may view reducing carbon emissions as an efficient strategy to draw attention away from higher political risks. Further analyses reveal that this tactic is adopted mainly by resource-constrained companies that are smaller, underperforming, with lower cash reserves and cashflow from operations. Using a channel test, we also provide empirical evidence that reducing scope 2 emissions in response to higher political risks may have helped firms avoid lower market valuation. Our findings are robust to a series of sensitivity and endogeneity checks.

	abstract = {This study examines how religiousness moderates the mental health effect of job insecurity, a prevalent stressor in modern societies. We use panel data from a representative, large sample of Dutch employees from 2008 to 2018. Exploiting the longitudinal nature of the data, we control for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity. Our main results indicate that job insecurity negatively affects men's but not women's mental health. Religious employees, however, are shielded from the adverse mental health effects of job insecurity. The protective effect of religiousness seems to be different for Catholics and Protestants: Protestant employees are shielded from the adverse mental health effects of job insecurity, whereas Catholic employees are not. Differences in work ethic and social network that religiousness may provide cannot explain the protective effect of religiousness. The mechanism at work appears to be a firm belief in God, as well as belief in life after death, in particular in combination with frequent attendance of religious gatherings or daily prayer. Unlike belief in God's existence, which shields only the religious, belief in life after death shields the religious and non-religious alike. The confluence of increasing job insecurity and increasing secularisation poses a risk to public mental health. Our results contribute to identifying employees who are particularly at risk and could, by shedding light on the mechanisms, suggest directions for potential preventive and curative interventions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Conflict remains a major driver of poverty in Africa. Conflicts and political instability in the region have been increasing recently and are drawing more attention in public discourse. While it is widely acknowledged that conflicts disrupt agricultural production and food systems, the full extent of the damage inflicted on the lives and livelihoods of farming households and the mechanisms to redress this harm remain poorly understood. In particular, the link between violent conflicts and households’ land allocation and related agricultural investment decisions remains understudied. In this study, we use geocoded longitudinal data along with detailed agricultural panel household surveys in Nigeria to assess the impact of violent conflicts on crop choice decisions and related agricultural investments. Specifically, we explore how farmers’ land allocation and agricultural investment decisions relate or respond to the outbreak and intensity of violent conflicts. We find that violent conflicts are associated with a reduction in the share of both land area cultivated and area harvested. We also find suggestive evidence that violent conflicts may shape farmers’ crop choices and related investments, as violent conflicts are associated with reduction in the share of land allocated to long-term crops (e.g., perennial crops, trees, roots and tubers). Overall, our findings suggest that violent conflicts can negatively influence farmers’ agricultural investments directly by affecting both land utilization patterns and portfolio allocation across activities with varying returns to investments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The estimation method considered in this analysis is the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) method. The analysis uses panel data covering the period from 2002 to 2021. This work differs from previous work because it captures the efficiency of investment using the incremental capital output ratio (ICOR) which is appropriate for low-income countries. In addition, this work takes into account the long-run view that is appropriate for macroeconomic analysis of political instability. The results reveal that, in the long term, political instability reduces the efficiency of domestic investment, public investment and private investment. The results suggest that the macroeconomic efficiency of domestic investment should be sought by combating political violence, government instability and internal conflicts, which are three key indicators of political instability. The results also suggest that emphasis should be placed on protecting private investment, which is more vulnerable than public investment in the context of political instability in the WAEMU. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Somalia faces significant challenges in maintaining low unemployment and achieving sustainable economic growth, especially due to traditional development bottlenecks such as political instability, inadequate infrastructure and excessive reliance on foreign aid. Realizing the need for inclusiveness of growth, this study empirically investigates the relationship between unemployment and the selected macroeconomic variables, namely, government expenditure, gross domestic product (GDP), agricultural value added and official development assistance (ODA), using annual data from 1990 to 2023. The study employs the Autoregressive Distributed Lag to estimate both the long run as well as short-run dynamics, while the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test is employed to ascertain stationarity of the variables, and Granger causality tests help us in determining causal direction among variables. The long-term findings reveal that increased government expenditure, GDP growth and agricultural output play a significant part in reducing unemployment, while ODA exerts a minimal influence on raising unemployment with implications of possible inefficiencies or aid dependency. Short-term unemployment dynamics are influenced by both GDP and agriculture. While GDP consistently reduces unemployment across lags, agriculture has mixed effects that suggest short-term frictions or transition issues. Causality analysis shows that there is a two-way causal relationship between GDP, government spending and ODA and a unidirectional relationship between unemployment and government spending. These findings require concentrated fiscal policy, efficient public spending, incremental agricultural modernization and better-linked foreign assistance focused on employment creation steps vital to the reduction of unemployment and the support of inclusive, sustainable growth in Somalia’s unsettled economic environment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This study investigates how compound shocks (the 2022 Durban floods, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the 2021 civil unrest) affect the economic sustainability of indigenous food crop vendors in South Africa. A cross-sectional survey of 34 vendors at Durban’s Warwick Early Morning Market was conducted, with data analyzed using descriptive statistics, and robust regression modeling. Results show that 88% of vendors experienced income loss due to flooding, 71% due to COVID-19, and 68% due to unrest. The regression model identified lack of cold storage (β = 1.53, p < 0.01), crop perishability (β = 1.10, p < 0.05), and exposure to these shocks as statistically significant predictors of income reduction. These findings highlight the urgent need for inclusive urban food governance, investment in post-harvest infrastructure, and support for informal vendors as key actors in achieving SDG-aligned, climate-resilient food systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This study investigates the short- and long-term effects of demographic variables on Somalia’s economic growth using the ARDL model and a 38-year time-series dataset (1985–2023). The findings reveal that life expectancy positively impacts economic growth in both the short and long run, highlighting the role of improved health and longevity in enhancing productivity. The dependency ratio has a positive long-term effect on economic growth, suggesting that Somalia’s socio-economic structure, characterized by extended family networks and informal economic activities, mitigates the economic burden of dependents. In the short run, however, the dependency ratio has a negative but statistically insignificant effect on GDP per capita. Population growth has a significant negative impact on economic growth in both the short and long run, indicating that rapid population expansion strains resources and hinders development. Additionally, internal conflict adversely affects economic growth, underscoring the consequences of political instability. The study recommends investing in healthcare, promoting education and job creation, enhancing governance, and fostering entrepreneurship to improve labor market participation and drive long-term economic growth.

Rather than focusing on regulatory interventions in a narrow administrative sense, SDG 4 is conceptualized as a reflection of national efforts to improve access to and quality of education, including institutional reforms, policy initiatives, and capacity-building measures in post-conflict settings. The analysis covers 16 countries affected by conflict and instability across Eastern Europe, including Ukraine; the Balkans (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, Slovenia); the Middle East (Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syrian Arab Republic, Turkey); and the South Caucasus (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia), using data from 2011 to 2020. Employing multivariate confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), the study reveals statistically significant and conceptually meaningful covariances between the selected SDGs. The strongest relationship is observed between SDG 8 and SDG 9, underscoring the interdependence of economic growth, industrial development, and innovation. Moderate but significant correlations between SDG 4 and both SDG 8 and SDG 9 highlight the foundational role of education in enabling socio-economic recovery and technological advancement. Key indicators such as primary school completion, secondary and tertiary enrollment, employment in industry and services, and high-tech value-added production serve as measurable proxies for these dynamics. The findings emphasize the importance of aligning education policy with broader development strategies to support resilience and sustainable growth in fragile contexts. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This research examines the influence of political risk, digitization and environmental policies, along with a set of economic and environmental factors, on the sustainable development of the BRICS economies. For the period from 1990 to 2020, the diagnostic tests confirmed a mixed order of integration. Therefore, the autoregressive distributed lag test is utilized and the results show that political risk, mineral resources and exports are harmful to sustainable development in the short run but significantly enhance sustainable development in the long run. On the other hand, environmental technologies are positively associated with sustainable development in the short run but transform into negative development in the long run. These diverse influences occur in the short and long run. The results indicate a consistent influence of digitization (positive) in both the short and long run. The long-run results are authenticated using panel fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS). Furthermore, the panel causality test validates diverse inferences regarding the causal association between the variables. Following the empirical outcomes, we recommend policies regarding equitable implementation of digital technologies, enhanced investment in environmental and green technologies, equitable resource management and a reduction in political risk, which could stimulate sustainable development. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Using panel econometric approaches, this study confirms the heterogeneity of slopes and cross-sectional dependence. Using linear regression with the heteroscedastic panel-corrected standard error approach, the results show that economic expansion, political risk and the quadratic R&D term significantly enhance the clean energy transition. However, natural resources, conventional technological innovation and research and development expenditures are the leading barriers to a clean energy transition in the region. The robustness of these results is validated by a series of panel regressions. Following the empirical outcomes, this study recommends rapid enhancement of the research and development budget, strengthening of governance and institutions and investment in technological innovation to attain a sustainable transition towards clean energy sources. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: This study addresses the challenge of stabilizing rice retail prices in Indonesia, where rice is a critical staple food, as in many Asian countries. The government prioritizes price stability to prevent sharp increases that could trigger social unrest during shortages. Price control approaches are categorized as direct or indirect. Direct controls involve immediate interventions, such as boosting rice stocks through imports to quickly influence market prices. Indirect controls consist of longer-term measures, like enhancing domestic production capacity for gradual stabilization. This study proposes an optimization model to determine the optimal rice import volume to minimize bi-monthly retail price fluctuations. Methods: A linear programming model is formulated to minimize bimonthly price changes, subject to constraints including local production capacity, import limits, rice flow balance, and demand fulfillment. The monthly retail price is modeled using a compound linear regression approach with seven explanatory variables: the rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar, GDP per capita, the price of ground dry rice (GKG) per kilogram, domestic rice procurement, rice imports, rice distribution, and government-managed rice stock aimed at ensuring domestic availability and price stability. The explanatory variable is forecasted using methods best suited to its historical pattern. Results: The model was tested using data from 2020 to 2023. The results indicate that bimonthly rice prices increases can be effectively controlled, with maximum price change rates maintained between 0.75% and 1.14% and a standard deviation ranging from 0.20% to 0.34%. These values are significantly lower than the anticipated inflation rate of 2–3%. Conclusions: The optimization model effectively determines the required volume of rice imports to minimize bimonthly retail price fluctuations. By regulating import volumes, excessive price increases can be prevented. Enhanced data-driven forecasting with granular historical data may further improve the accuracy of retail rice price predictions and strengthen price stabilization initiatives. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The empirical analyses are carried out through multiple and partial wavelet coherence techniques employing quarterly data from 1984Q1 and 2021Q4. To the best of the author’s knowledge, there is no study in related literature investigating the connectedness between human capital investment of government and economic growth considering the level of political and economic risk within the country through wavelet tools. Therefore, the main contribution of this study is to fill this gap both in academic literature and the policy arena. According to the empirical outcomes, the strongest connectedness exists between economic growth and government health investment until 2013. However, from 2018, it has been observed that economic risk and economic growth connectedness are stronger in the short and medium run, as in the case of the UK. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {One of the most important trends noted by researchers in the revolutionary events of recent decades is the rapid increase in the share of unarmed revolutionary uprisings and, accordingly, a decrease in the share of armed revolutionary insurgencies. The study of this trend is of great importance. This work continues previous research on unarmed revolutionary destabilization. Unlike in past studies, the authors here have significantly expanded the time range taken into account, considered together the main factors in the onset of unarmed (~ “nonviolent”) revolutionary uprisings, and significantly improved the methodology by combining these factors within one model. As a result, the study found that most variables are related to the probability of an onset of unarmed revolutions in a curvilinear manner, which explains the weak statistical relationship for some variables in the works of predecessors. The following have a non-linear relationship: the duration of the regime’s existence, economic growth, the level of democracy, the degree of corruption within the regime, urbanization, GDP per capita, the “youth bulge”, oil production, levels of discrimination. In addition, the key determinants of the onset of unarmed revolutionary uprisings were identified and ranked in order of their importance. The analysis performed allows us to assume that the onset of unarmed revolutionary uprisings is most likely in upper middle income states with young political regimes, high populations, very low (as well as very high) rates of economic growth, intermediate political regimes (partial democracy or, especially, partial autocracy), a high level of corruption of the regime (despite the fact that an extremely high level of corruption still has a rather inhibiting effect on the likelihood of an unarmed revolution onset), significant financial assistance from the United States, a fairly high level of coverage of population with modern formal education, a very long incumbent duration, a fairly high proportion of urban residents in the total population, the presence of a certain culture of protest, as well as low or no oil income. At the same time, it is confirmed that the likelihood of the outbreak of unarmed revolutions has increased markedly after the end of the Cold War due to changes in the global geopolitical situation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The international investment regime provides generous protections for foreign investors against adverse legal changes in host states, and unusually strong procedural rights to enforce those protections in investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS). Scholars have observed that the regime enables corporate capital accumulation and raises the costs of climate action, potentially deterring states from adopting ambitious climate policies. Building on this literature, we locate a key source of these concerns in the asymmetric treatment of state and investor behavior in ISDS, which allows investors to depict themselves as innocent victims of “unfair” and “unforeseeable” “political” processes, despite themselves being active political players and sophisticated political risk managers—a tactic we call feigned victimization. This tactic is employed by fossil fuel companies to achieve capital accumulation and climate obstruction goals. We illustrate our argument through an empirical case study of TC Energy’s US$15 billion ISDS claim against the United States in relation to the Biden Administration’s revocation of a permit required to construct the Keystone XL oil pipeline. Our case study also illustrates a method by which states can expose feigned victimization tactics by investors and incorporate evidence of this into their legal defenses in ISDS. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) plays a crucial role in economic growth, particularly in fragile states like Somalia. Despite its strategic location and resource potential, Somalia faces challenges such as political instability, weak infrastructure, and climate vulnerabilities that deter investors. This study explores the economic and environmental determinants of FDI in Somalia, focusing on GDP growth, inflation, population growth, urbanization, rainfall, and temperature. Using time-series data and the ARDL model, it examines both the direct effects of these variables and the moderating role of GDP growth. Findings confirm a long-term relationship where GDP and population growth enhance FDI, while inflation and rising temperatures hinder investment. Rainfall positively influences FDI, reflecting its importance in Somalia's agriculture-dependent economy. Urbanization remains insignificant in the long run due to unplanned growth. In the short term, population growth, urbanization, and temperature significantly affect FDI, while GDP, inflation, and rainfall show weaker immediate effects. The moderation analysis suggests that GDP growth mitigates climate-related investment risks. This study underscores the need for economic stability, infrastructure development, and climate adaptation strategies to attract sustainable FDI and promote long-term growth in Somalia. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Additionally, in modern geopolitical challenges, escalating economic pressures, and regional disparities in renewable energy development further complicate the global transition to sustainable energy. This article aims to define the role of renewable energy sources in ensuring sustainable economic development and analyze the influence of key factors on their implementation in sustainable development. We analyzed literature sources, and statistical data, followed by comparative analysis, systematization, and generalization, to identify the key factors influencing the implementation of renewable energy sources. The expert assessment method revealed the impact of internal and external factors on the development of the energy sector. These factors include Politics (P), Economy (E), Social sphere (S), Technology (T), Ecology (E) and Law (L) pillars that influence the implementation of renewable energy sources in ensuring sustainable economic development. The findings suggest that political instability (P1--2.7) and the destruction of energy infrastructure (P2-3.0), as well as economic factors (Total E-5.05 /-8.33), are currently the main negative factors affecting the renewable energy sector in Ukraine. Additionally, social (Total S-4.63 /-8.67) and environmental aspects (Total E-3.9 /-8.125) still lack adequate management by the government and public perception, negatively impacting the further development of renewable energy sources. At the same time, technological innovations (Total T-9.1 /-9.1) and the legal environment (Total L-9.16 /-9.16) show potential for further sectoral development. The implementation of alternative energy sources and the overall support of the energy sector mainly depend on balanced policies in the electricity sector, the sector's investment attractiveness, social support, and the availability of technological innovations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Geopolitical risk (GPR) presents a profound challenge to firms, particularly in regions with persistent political instability. In Eastern Europe, where conflicts like the Russia–Ukraine war heighten uncertainty, firms face immediate financial threats and long-term strategic vulnerabilities. This study examines the impact of GPR on firm performance, focusing on the moderating role of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices as a resilience mechanism. Using a comprehensive dataset of 1360 publicly listed firms across Poland, Russia, and Ukraine from 2014 to 2023, the analysis employs a base panel data regression model, followed by a two-step generalized method of moments (GMM) approach to account for endogeneity and ensure robustness. The findings reveal a significant negative relationship between GPR and firm performance, measured by return on assets (ROA). Firms exposed to higher geopolitical risks exhibit weaker profitability. However, firms with stronger ESG performance demonstrate greater resilience, as the GMM results show that ESG engagement moderates the adverse effects of GPR on profitability. This suggests that ESG initiatives enhance adaptive capacity in volatile geopolitical environments. In terms of policy implications, ESG should be promoted as a key strategy for firms operating in politically unstable regions. Governments and regulatory bodies may consider mandatory ESG disclosures and incentivizing sustainability practices to help firms mitigate external risks, improve financial resilience, and attract stable investment. Aligning corporate strategies with global ESG standards is essential to ensuring business sustainability amid ongoing geopolitical threats. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, different business environments among countries have led to the problem of a low and uneven distribution of China’s overall trade and investment efficiency in the countries along the route. Using the stochastic frontier gravity model, this study evaluates the efficiency of China’s outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) based on the data of 47 countries along the Belt and Road route from 2013 to 2019. The empirical results indicate that the efficiency level of China’s OFDI in countries located along the Belt and Road route is 43.39%, which suggests a regional imbalance. In terms of business environment factors, regulatory governance, civic discourse, government accountability, and regulatory quality in host countries have a positive impact on China’s OFDI. The positive effects of the BRI have enabled Chinese enterprises to better face factors such as political instability, corruption and imperfections in the legal system when investing abroad. The findings and suggestions could help the governments and enterprises of the countries along the route improve the business environment in a more targeted manner, enhance the space for economic and trade cooperation, and promote the common development of the countries along the route. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Mitigating and avoiding social unrest caused by ecological forest restoration is a key factor in the coordinated development of forests and society. Forests, which are intricately linked with society, serve as a vital source of timber, non-timber forest products, and ecosystem services. Ecological forest restoration projects must carefully consider the relationship between forests and society to promote their coordinated development. As a key implementation area for the Natural Forest Resource Protection Project, the state-owned forest regions in Northeast China have experienced a crisis regarding harvestable resources and social unrest caused by protection policies and are currently innovating in policies and practices to mitigate social unrest. This study focuses on the history of natural forest resource conservation projects in China’s state-owned forest areas as a case study for empirical research, aiming to provide insights into ecological restoration models that foster harmony between forests and society. The empirical analyses reveal the following findings: (1) As a result of strict protection, natural forest resources on state-owned land have transitioned from providing timber to ecosystem services and non-timber products. (2) The strict logging ban policy has led to severe resource shortages; from 2000 to 2020, for every 10,000 cubic meter decrease in timber harvest, the per capita output in state-owned forest areas has dropped by more than CNY 500 (approximately USD 70). (3) Proactive ecological restoration can effectively alleviate social unrest; from 2000 to 2020, for every additional 10,000 hectares of forest tending, the average wage increased by more than CNY 900 (approximately USD 127). (4) Regional transformation can effectively generate a buffer effect to mitigate social unrest caused by strict forest protection policies and leverage the beneficial resources produced by ecological forest restoration to develop new drivers of economic growth. By systematically reviewing the comprehensive implementation of the NFPP, this paper’s findings provide insights into ecological restoration strategies that promote the harmonious development of forests and society. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Under the risk mitigation hypothesis, EPR discourse lowers crash risk, whereas, under the risk escalation hypothesis, management may exploit information asymmetry leading to greater crash risk. Results from US firm-year observations reveal that the EPR discourse of the current year reduces the crash risk of the following year, thus supporting the risk mitigation hypothesis. Further, this study shows that the effect of EPR discourse on crash risk is more pronounced for politically active firms, potentially due to their proximity to the political decision-making process and better access to associated information. Additionally, the results suggest that the negative association between EPR discourse and crash risk is stronger in the democrat regimes and for the firms with more institutional monitoring and characterised by a higher level of integrity. Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting machine learning algorithms support the effectiveness of EPR discourse in predicting crash risk. The primary results remain robust to potential endogeneity concerns. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {How do states maintain economic development in the face of sanctions? Recent studies have examined economic resilience as a property of a system preceding a shock, leaving unanswered questions about how sanctioned states discipline employers and limit predatory behaviour. Using the case of Iran, this article aims to fill this gap by presenting a model of Mobilized resilience, describing how bottom-up and top-down mobilizations can create demand for institutional capacity. Integrating unique qualitative and quantitative material, the author argues that Iran's political elites responded to sanctions by launching top-down campaigns that appealed to workers, promoted capital–labour unity, and demanded state commitment to development. These campaigns facilitated widespread labour protests that further empowered the state to block capital flight and steer firms onto more profitable, growth-oriented routes. Labour ‘resistance’ thus unexpectedly helped to realize the Supreme Leader's calls for a ‘resistance economy’. These findings suggest that political support for worker mobilization in the context of sanctions can result in economic benefits, with significant consequences for our understanding of economic statecraft, development and labour movements. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

It argues that parties’ cohesive voting in Congress under different power constellations and parties’ voter-linkage strategies create institutional conditions of power collusion, inter-branch stalemate, or party erosion that delineates political terrain for social mobilization. First, the firm control of a single party or coalition over the executive and legislature with cohesive voting of party members in line with party leadership denotes power collusion and incites underrepresented actors to protest. Second, the dislocation in the executive-legislative relations (either with party members voting against the president’s proposals in a majority government or with cohesive opposition bloc(s) acting against the president’s will in a minority government) leads to policy immobilism and pushes legislative parties to ignite popular discontent. Third, more programmatic party linkages increase the degree of party institutionalization and predictability about policy commitment and mitigate struggles in extra-electoral arenas. The theoretical argument is tested with a battery of statistical tests that lend credence to the institutional explanations of mass mobilization. This is corroborated with empirical cases that show the plausibility of the statistical findings in particular contexts. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In the dynamic context of modern business, the role of religion in business management is increasingly attracting the attention of researchers and practitioners. Religion, seen as a set of spiritual beliefs and practices, deeply shapes people's values, behaviors, and decisions, thus impacting the way organizations are managed. Using bibliometric analysis allowed us to identify research trends, the links between the keywords underlying the selected studies, and the impact of the publications on the business environment. The study revealed that religious values can shape ethical behavior, leadership styles, and corporate social responsibility in business. Most studies focus on the influences of Islamic, Catholic, and Protestant religions, leaving a significant gap in understanding how orthodox values and practices influence organizational behavior and business ethics, even though this is the dominant religion in many Eastern and South-Eastern European countries. For a more comprehensive perspective, future research should include case studies and surveys in these geographical and cultural regions, combining qualitative and quantitative methods of data analysis. This study provides a robust basis for future research, stimulating reflection on how religious values can shape the business landscape in the 21st century. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The ASEAN region, which is relatively more open in terms of both trade openness as well as FDI inflows, is chosen as a sample. Annual data are gathered from “World Development Indicators (WDI)” and “World Governance Indicators (WGI)”. Reported results and findings are based on “Fixed Effect (FE) Modeling”, and the “Generalized Least Square (GLS)” is utilized for the robustness check. The results indicated that trade openness matters significantly for attracting FDI inflows. Similarly, institutional quality has also exerted a positive and significant influence on the inflows of FDI. The disaggregated analysis shows that five aspects of institutional quality, such as rule of law, regulatory quality, control of corruption, voice and accountability, and political instability and absence of violence, have positively and significantly impacted the FDI inflows in the case of selected ASEAN economies. The results demonstrated that exchange rate depreciation is harmful for the inflows of FDI. Moreover, FDI inflows responded positively to market size. Furthermore, the results showed that the impact of natural resources and inflation on FDI inflows is insignificant statistically. The present study suggests that the ASEAN policymakers manage their exchange rate effectively, improve the quality of institutions, and adopt vigorous trade liberalization policies to attract more FDI inflows. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

On the one hand, it charts the emergence of firms in Somalia and Somaliland at the intersection of telecommunication and finance, eventually controlling logistics through digital platforms that enable the circulation of people, goods and value across the region. On the other, it examines the historical and political elements that have shaped a peculiar instance of digital capitalism against a backdrop of protracted insecurity and state fragility. It uses the specific case-study of digital platforms in the Somali HoA to provide insights into the multiple shapes that digital capitalism can take. To advance the authors' analysis, the article links the notions of digital infrastructural power and 'extrastatecraft'. Empirically, it delves into the case of digital platforms in the Somali HoA to illustrate how the unique digital landscape of the region has evolved over fifty years of political instability and economic volatility. Theoretically, the article navigates the implications of the state's heavy reliance on privately owned and managed platforms amid the backdrop of variegated digital capitalism narratives, which have predominantly centred on the global North. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

On September 20, 2019, for example, millions of Gen-Zs from over 150 different countries across the globe embarked on a protest to pressure decision-makers and governments to help save the planet. Such campaigns have caused firms to rethink how they operate by adopting green operations in their production and distribution of products. The footwear industry is not left out. The problem this research sought to address is the assessment of the effect of green consumer knowledge on green purchase behavior among Gen-Z consumers towards footwear while assessing the roles of consumer social responsibility, green advertising, and green consumer trust. The study was quantitative in nature and used an online questionnaire to survey 559 Chinese Gen-Z consumers. Findings revealed that although green consumer knowledge had a direct effect on green purchase behavior, this effect was partially mediated by consumer social responsibility. The effect of consumer social responsibility on green purchase behavior was positively moderated by green advertising, and the moderating effect of green advertising was further strengthened by green consumer trust. Finally, the mediating effect of consumer social responsibility was conditional on the moderating effects of green advertising and green consumer trust. It was concluded that green consumer knowledge is an essential ingredient in enhancing Gen-Z consumers' green purchase behavior towards footwear, as such, advocacy and pressure groups must increasingly conscientize consumers. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The project consists of lengthy interviews with business leaders from emerging markets. By June 2024, 183 interviews had been conducted with business leaders in 34 countries in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. Selected interviewees needed at least three decades of experience in business, and they must be assessed as highly impactful. The CEM project was conceived from the beginning as a public goods project. The transcripts of interviews are fully accessible on the project website. They can be downloaded by anyone with an internet connection, and they can be used in research and teaching without permission. The note goes on to explain how the CEM database has been employed in multiple academic publications, targeted at both historical and management audiences, and employing multiple methodologies. Examples include a study of gender and skin color stereotypes in the film industries in India, a comparison of how businesses perceived political risk in Latin America and South Asia, an analysis of business investment in education, and a study of spiritual philanthropy in emerging markets. Multiple methodologies have been employed including coding and the application of machine learning to undertake facial and text analysis of CEM interviews. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In particular, home country governments pursue their own foreign policies independently of business, forging international linkages with other countries in pursuit of tangible benefits. But what happens when a government forges connectivity to a country which exhibits volatility or generates geopolitical shocks? This paper examines this question by studying the response of European stock markets to the ongoing (since 2014) Russian invasion of Ukraine. Using a variety of metrics to measure political connectivity, we distinguish between anti-Russian governments and governments which are more favorable to Russia during this period, combining this connectivity data with a new database of sanctions and war-related events. Applying asymmetric GARCH, panel estimations, and event study methods, we find that the uncertainty caused by Russian aggression in Ukraine has harmed financial markets in countries such as Serbia and Hungary, countries which have willingly forged connections with Russia during this time. Consistently, our empirical results show that, by tying a country to another one via political means, politicians also have tied the fortunes of their capital markets to the success or failure of this partner. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In this paper, we examine the impact of political risk on the location decisions of Chinese small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and explore the legitimacy of firms from China in different host countries as a moderator of the relationship between political risk and location choice. Our empirical investigation is based on an original database of 617 foreign direct investment (FDI) location-choice decisions made by 240 Chinese SMEs between 2006 and 2017. The results show that political risk deters Chinese SMEs from choosing certain locations, but political and economic legitimacy positively mitigate this relationship. Combining the political institutions approach and legitimacy-based view of political risk, we contribute novel insights into the role of legitimacy of firms from the same country of origin in emerging market SMEs’ strategic choices of FDI location. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Amidst the increasing ecological pressures arising from industrial activity and consumerism, with particularly tangible impacts outside of the global north, the private sector is being held accountable to reduce its environmental footprint and transition to sustainable business models and processes. Nevertheless, perceptions of sustainability and its dimensions largely vary between cultures and contexts, while local media discourses both shape and reflect those concepts and narratives. This in turn shapes sustainability practices and the nature and impacts of emerging entrepreneurial business activity. Given the dearth of sustainability research in the Middle East & North Africa (MENA) and the region’s extreme vulnerability to climate change, pollution, draughts combined with political instability and institutional fragility, this paper provides an in-depth analysis of media narratives at the intersection of sustainability and entrepreneurship in the region. This was done by means of the machine learning method of topic modelling on two datasets of 486 and 217 news media articles extracted from a major regional English-language news outlet, followed by a manual content analysis of the extracted topics and articles. We find that the term sustainability is highly associated with economic prosperity and that ecology-related themes are often formulated in terms of financial gain, for instance transitioning out of oil & gas dependence. We find a surprising lack of focus on water scarcity and biodiversity, coupled with a welcomed focus on the energy transition, recycling, urban mobility, as well as social networking and minority integration. Our findings hence provide a nuanced contextual understanding of sustainability, which may support businesses and decision-makers alike in (re)defining priorities and reflecting upon the status quo and necessary next steps in the transition to more sustainable societies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

By adopting autoregressive distributed lag and non-linear autoregressive distributed lag approaches for panel data from 1978 to 2022, the results indicate an asymmetric cointegration among variables, and positive and negative changes in tourism development lead to decreased income inequality. More specifically, the asymmetric effect of tourism is found both in the short- and long-term, and positive shock has a greater impact than negative shock. At the same time, the findings also reveal that economic growth and globalization enhance, while human capital negatively affects income inequality in Singapore.

	abstract = {Globally, managing political risk is an essential component of international contracting and project management. Due to political unpredictability and volatility in most nations, there could be a substantial influence on the successful completion of any construction project. To mitigate this, contractors employ a systematic strategy for risk management, including expropriation, civil disturbance, and shifts in governmental policies taking into consideration all the political risks connected to global projects. As a result of the political volatility, there is a need for political risk management (PRM) approaches by the International Construction Corporation (ICC). This study investigates the risk identification techniques for international contracting professionals in the construction sector. The methodology for conducting this investigation is based on data collection through questionnaires from construction sector professionals in both academia and industry. The tools were used to develop essential components from the factors established. This was then analysed using quantitative techniques to examine identified risk factors and make study deductions. The findings of this study identified the crucial PRM-related implications for global initiatives and various risks that were considered in typical construction projects. The political environment should be thoroughly examined, prospective risks should be noted, and risk-reduction tactics should be included in this plan. Thus, a successful project is achievable when contractors can identify the risks, preserve their investments, minimize project delays, handle disruptions, and boost project success rates. Additionally, political risks are invariably associated with construction projects, and this is considered a concern for foreign contractors. Thus, good identification techniques will ensure project preparedness, which is required by expatriates and foreign contractors. This is necessary as they need to ensure that their projects are successfully handled and that there are alternative plans to handle any unexpected event on the project. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Our concept provides a bottom-up complement to established measures that focus more on political and institutional players and the institutional constraints they face. Our grassroots SPR index attempts to capture public pressure to initiate institutional change in a country. In contrast to existing measures, our Google Trends–based measure captures issue salience directly among individuals rather than media or analyst reports. As such, it is uniquely representative of socio-political sentiment, timely, and widely available. Our concept and measure offer international business (IB) researchers novel opportunities. In addition to developing the index, we scrutinize its validity and provide an illustrative empirical application in the IB context by showing that differences between internal and external assessments of grassroots SPR are contingent on psychic distance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Beyond unexpected variation in socio-political environments over time, the difference between home and host country socio-political contexts induces risk as it increases the difficulty to understand a foreign environment. This risk is specifically important for internationally active firms, as they need to gather and interpret information stemming from different socio-political environments to manage their international operations. However, existing literature lacks both concept and measure to capture such information asymmetry. In this paper, we explain how cross-national distance is related to SPRs through information asymmetry, and develop a reflective measure of cross-national distance based on information theory, signal analysis, and financial market information.

However, predominant methods in the field of international business are, for the most part, limited in their capacity to directly address the complexity intrinsic to socio-political risks. We propose overcoming this limitation by adopting a configurational approach that enables researchers to embrace the complexity of socio-political risks in international business. We explain the fundamental principles of a configurational approach and the typical stages for using its methodological tool, Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). We then outline how scholars can use QCA to pursue future research avenues that identify the configurations of conditions that constitute socio-political risks or the effects of socio-political risks on diverse outcomes of interest. We also clarify how the international business field can benefit from the use of QCA in the study of socio-political risks by advancing knowledge of international business in emerging and informal markets, where data access is limited. These efforts aim to motivate international business and management scholars to broaden their empirical toolbox for the study of socio-political risks by engaging in configurational thinking and theorizing. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Therefore, this work aims to shed light on this gap by choosing 989 listed non-financial Asian firms and performing both the static (fixed-effects) and dynamic (Difference-GMM and System‐GMM) panel data methods between 2008 and 2020. The findings reveal that an increase in a country's risk and global uncertainty stimulates firms to stockpile more cash though the impact of country risk is more pronounced. Likewise, the results underscore that among the country risk factors, firms have more precautionary motives to stockpile more cash with increases in financial and political instability while they hold more cash with rises in economic stability. Remarkably, the results emphasize that the impacts of country risk and global uncertainty on cash holdings are more prominent in environments characterized by common-law legal origin, high uncertainty avoidance cultures, and less financial market development. Moreover, the results reveal that firm-specific factors including growth opportunity, leverage, profitability, dividend, and size have an important role in shaping Asian firms' cash holdings policy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Firms lobby politicians to increase their share of government contracts, but political competition creates firm-level risk, inflating their cost of capital and reducing their incentive to invest in research and development (R&D). I document an annual 6-8% return premium for stocks of high-lobbying firms, which compensates investors for political risk. An estimated model in which firms can lobby and innovate and investors are risk averse replicates key features of corporate lobbying in the U.S., including the well-established paradox that lobbying contributions are small relative to the policies at stake. The model predicts that if investors ceased seeking compensation for political risk, R&D investment would increase by 6% and the innovation rate by 0.4% points. The risk-premium costs of lobbying are quantitatively and economically important even if the resources "wasted"on lobbying are objectively small. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Nickel is an important key resource and plays an increasingly important role in new energy technologies. The stability of its worldwide supply chain is crucial for addressing country risks and unforeseen events. To explore the impact of country risks on the stability of the global nickel supply chain, this study conducts a complex network analysis and panel regression analysis on nickel ore, ferro-nickel, and the stainless-steel trade data from 2000 to 2022. The study reveals the mechanisms by which economic and political risks affect the trade structure of nickel commodities and identifies the drivers of global nickel supply chain patterns. The study finds that an increase in economic risk promotes diversification of supply sources, while political risk hurts export scale and resource control ability. Industrial structure adjustments and R&D investments have a significant impact on trade structure, especially on the stainless-steel trade. China is a major consumer and importer, and occupies a central position in the global nickel trade network, while Indonesia and the Philippines’ policy changes have a significant impact on the market. This study provides an empirical basis for the risk management of the global nickel supply chain and a scientific basis for policy formulation and strategic planning. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This study investigates the impact of alternative food networks (AFNs) in Romania, focusing on their potential as sustainable counterpoints to the global fast-food economy. Existing global food regimes are characterized by neoliberal accumulation and lack viability at national and local levels, with recent farmer protests across Europe highlighting the need for sustainable solutions. By combining quantitative and qualitative methods, this study examines the nature and dynamics of AFNs in Romania and the influence of urban-rural interactions on their evolution. The findings reveal the importance of collective solutions for current food systems and the pivotal role of urban-rural synergies in shaping short food supply chains. The study highlights the benefits of advocating for sustainable food production practices and the need for direct and efficient food distribution in Romania.

	abstract = {A common narrative among insurance actuaries and business economists is that national or regional pension systems can be finetuned, optimized, and improved simply by tinkering with demographic and financial parameters; all within the context of the “right” mathematical model. Indeed, recent papers in the actuarial literature have offered technical fixes around savings rates, retirement ages, decumulation strategies as well as more refined mortality and interest rate models. But alas, not everything in the world of pensions and retirement can be optimized, in particular as it relates to the history, background culture, or religion of the underlying population. This paper documents a statistically significant relationship between a region’s pension plan “health status” and the fraction of the region’s population identifying as Protestant Christians (PC). We begin the analysis at the national level using a well-known pension quality index and then obtain similar results for the actuarial funded status of U.S. state pension plans. Overall, this work is within the sphere of recent literature that indicates historical religious beliefs, values, and culture matter for financial economic outcomes; a factor which obviously can’t be optimized within a mathematical Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation. In other words, some things in retirement are truly beyond control. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Financial development facilitates farmers’ access to credit resources, enabling the adoption of innovative technologies for energy management. On the other hand, long-term planning for agricultural businesses is expected to reduce various types of risks, including financial risk, thus promoting production. Therefore, the aim of this study is to empirically investigate the relationship between development and financial risk with energy consumption in the agricultural sector in Iran and selected developing countries. For this purpose, financial development indicators such as the ratio of deposits and bank facilities to agricultural value-added, as well as economic, financial, and political risk indicators, have been used for two groups of oil-exporting and non-oil-exporting developing countries during the years 2010 to 2020. In order to analyze the data, the Smooth Transition Regression model was used, which allows for examining non-linear relationships between variables. The findings suggest significant differences in the average per capita agricultural energy consumption between the studied oil-exporting and non-oil-exporting countries. Other research results indicate the superiority of non-linear specification relationships between variables and their threshold behavior. Financial development has an inverse effect on per capita energy consumption, and an increase in various types of risk (financial, economic, and political) is associated with an increase in per capita energy consumption in the agricultural sector. The magnitude of the impact of variables in non-oil-exporting countries is generally estimated to be higher than in oil-exporting countries. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The pursuit of a sustainable environment is a common goal for many nations; however, achieving this has become increasingly difficult due to country-specific risks, often referred to as country risk. Despite its importance, the relationship between country risk and environmental outcomes is still in its early stages of exploration. This study aims to bridge this gap by examining the influence of country risk on India's ecological footprint within an asymmetric empirical framework, while accounting for economic growth and coal energy consumption. Utilizing the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) estimator, the analysis covers data from 1984 to 2018. The findings reveal that positive changes in economic and financial risk contribute to environmental improvement by significantly reducing the ecological footprint, whereas negative changes in these risks lead to an increase in ecological footprint. Additionally, positive changes in political risk, economic growth, and coal energy usage exacerbate the ecological footprint, while reductions in coal energy use and political risk lead to environmental benefits. Based on these outcomes, policymakers are encouraged to establish a clear risk benchmark and reduce the ecological footprint by fostering economic growth in a sustainable manner. Governments should also prioritize strong support for green technology investments and ensure stability across political, economic, and financial sectors to promote long-term environmental sustainability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The study employed a panel data of 17 commercial banks for the period of 2012 to 2022, consisting of 187 bank-year observations. The regression outcomes reveal that political stability has a negative and statistically significant impact on the profitability of banks in the case of Ethiopia. This means that bank’s profitability declines as the country’s political instability rises. Moreover, the regression results reveal that the profitability of banks in Ethiopia is shaped by other customary variables, which are bank-specific, industry-specific, and macroeconomic variables. The findings are stout and dependable as another model specification is undertaken. To the researcher’s knowledge, the present study is the first to analyse the effect of political stability on the profitability of banks in Ethiopia. As a result, it provides better insights for the policymakers, regulators, bank managers, analysts, and other interested parties to improve the profitability of Ethiopian banks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, there is limited research on how social media messages can trigger diverse connective actions, quantifying more precisely the different forms of online engagement generated with social protest, especially those related with environment and climate change.

Results evidence that depends on who send messages (Greta Thunberg and icon-influencers), what content (“not supporting the movement” and “information about COVID-19 and digital strikes”), when (during business hours), and how (audiovisual format and other hashtags), higher levels of online engagement with #fridaysforfuture are generated via retweets, cited tweets, likes, comments, and replies to comments. This study contributes to previous literature expanding the empirical applications of the connective action theory, using a broader and deeper metric of online engagement with social movements, and providing a bigger picture on the debate on the importance of message strategies to generate higher engagement with social protest.

Furthermore, we hypothesizes that availability of cash (CA) will have direct and positive effect on EXP. Using partial least square structural equation model (PLS-SEM), the researchers test the hypotheses based on a dataset of 161 firms from Ethiopian manufacturing sector (i.e., Leather industry, textile industry, and Food & Beverage industry). The study confirms that CS, IC in home countries, and PI in home countries have significant negative effects on the EXP of the firms’. On the other hand, there is no statistically significant direct relation exists between CA and firm’s EXP as measured by sales volume and sales revenue.

Amid increasing competition and market instability, there is a need to develop innovative risk management strategies. The purpose of the study is to develop and test methods for assessing and minimising risks aimed at strengthening and sustainable development of enterprises in the hotel and restaurant business. Using abstract-logical analysis and a systematic approach, the study classifies enterprises depending on the level of risk. The results of this study demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of innovative management methods in the hotel and restaurant industry. The findings indicate that enterprises from the initial cluster are less vulnerable to risks, confirming the effectiveness of cluster analysis in assessing risks in the hotel and restaurant sector. In conditions of economic and political instability, systematic analysis and risk management became important. Internal risk management strategies, including innovative methods, were successfully used to reduce potential threats to the hotel and restaurant business, considering the specifics of this industry. The development and support of a dynamic information system became a key element, facilitating effective risk management and enhancing the competitiveness of enterprises. The mentioned enterprises, remaining within the lowest level of risk, confirmed the importance of using cluster analysis for identifying and managing risks in the hotel and restaurant sector. This study introduces innovative approaches to risk management in the hotel and restaurant sphere, providing specific strategies that can be used by companies to increase resilience and adapt to market competition challenges. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This methodologically focused study examines the relationships between inflation and unemployment rates, political stability, and tourism, with particular emphasis on the impacts on tourist arrivals in Hungary. The research aims to uncover the direct and indirect influences of these macroeconomic indicators on the volume of tourism, specifically international tourist arrivals. The significance of the study lies in the clear correlation between economic stability and labor market conditions with tourism volume, where rising inflation and unemployment rates negatively correlate with the number of tourist arrivals. This relationship is further strengthened by the observation that improvements in political stability enhance tourist numbers over the long term, while political instability, such as conflicts and terrorist acts, negatively affects tourism demand. These correlations are crucial for aligning tourism policy with economic policy, as macroeconomic indicators and the political environment directly influence both domestic and foreign tourists’ willingness to travel. The research methodology focuses on forecasting using Random Forest and neural networks, which enables more accurate predictions of tourism volume and supports informed tourism policy-making. The findings indicate that the development of the tourism sector is closely linked to economic growth and underscore the necessity of boosting tourism to expand employment and maintain economic stability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Maintaining optimal levels of unemployment and external debt remains a significant challenge for ensuring consistent economic growth in many developing countries. Despite persistent economic difficulties marked by political instability, high unemployment, external debt, inflation, and limited capital formation, Somalia is increasingly recognizing the importance of fostering stability, instituting economic reforms, seeking debt relief through international collaborations, and promoting inclusive growth. Therefore, this paper empirically examines the relationship between gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment, external debt, inflation, and gross capital formation in Somalia using annual data from 1991 to 2021. To attain the aim of the study, we implemented the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF), vector error correction model (VECM), variance decomposition, impulse response function, and Granger causality test. The outcomes of the study present a negative relationship between unemployment and economic growth, implying the applicability of Okun’s law in Somalia. This suggests that the unemployment crisis in Somalia can be attributed to a lack of economic growth. Furthermore, the study identified that economic growth is negatively associated with inflation and external debt. Moreover, the study reveals unidirectional links between unemployment and GDP, gross capital formation and GDP, GDP and external debt, CPI and GDP, unemployment and gross capital formation, and external debt and unemployment. No causal effects were found in the other combinations of interactions. To sustain economic growth and job creation, the government must implement effective fiscal policies, create an inviting atmosphere, and have a flexible labour market policy to encourage the private sector and small businesses. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The Schumpeterian growth hypothesis is tested by employing the quantile regression to examine the role of innovation in determining income inequality for the selected South Asian countries. The empirical findings show that innovation, especially the number of patent applications, has a statistically significant and positive association with income inequality in South Asia which increases income inequality. For sustainable economic growth, everyone must be given equal economic opportunities in the economy, and the government must abolish capitalists’ oligopoly on wealth. Similarly, everyone must be given equal opportunities to innovate because innovation encourages not only productivity but also economic growth in the long run. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Burkina Faso joined the Global Financing Facility for Women, Children and Adolescents (GFF) in 2017 to address persistent gaps in funding for reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health and nutrition (RMNCAH-N). Few empirical papers deal with how global funding mechanisms, and specifically GFF, support resource mobilisation for health nationally. Objective: This study describes the policy processes of developing the GFF planning documents (the Investment Case and Project Appraisal Document) in Burkina Faso. Methods: We conducted an exploratory qualitative policy analysis. Data collection included document review (N = 74) and in-depth semi-structured interviews (N = 23). Data were analysed based on the components of the health policy triangle. Results: There was strong national political support to RMNCAH-N interventions, and the process of drawing up the investment case (IC) and the project appraisal document was inclusive and multi-sectoral. Despite high-level policy commitments, subsequent implementation of the World Bank project, including the GFF contribution, was perceived by respondents as challenging, even after the project restructuring process occurred. These challenges were due to ongoing policy fragmentation for RMNCAH-N, navigation of differing procedures and perspectives between stakeholders in the setting up of the work, overcoming misunderstandings about the nature of the GFF, and weak institutional anchoring of the IC. Insecurity and political instability also contributed to observed delays and difficulties in implementing the commitments agreed upon. To tackle these issues, transformational and distributive leaderships should be promoted and made effective. Conclusions: Few studies have examined national policy processes linked to the GFF or other global health initiatives. This kind of research is needed to better understand the range of challenges in aligning donor and national priorities encountered across diverse health systems contexts. This study may stimulate others to ensure that the GFF and other global health initiatives respond to local needs and policy environments for better implementation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This is also what happened in large movements involving young people in Indonesia, conventionally in the form of demonstrations and digital movements. This study seeks to explore the relationship between youth political participation, digital media, and the development of youth political identity by analyzing young people’s engagement in some of the most significant political protests in Indonesia during the mass protests of #ReformasiDikorupsi, a movement opposing the amendments of several important bills, and #TolakOmnibusLaw, a movement opposing the establishment of a new single bill related to labor and investment, between 2019 and 2020. By analyzing quantitative data through data mining from Twitter from October 2019 to November 2020 with the social network analysis method, this study discusses online youth participation in social movements and the way they shape their political identity. Our research found that young people play an active and central role in building online and offline movements. In particular, the online movement contributes to the growth of the offline protest movement, and vice versa, because of concerns about the practice of illiberal democracy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In the pursuit of sustainable development, economies such as China are placing a paramount emphasis on significantly augmenting the utilization of renewable energy sources. This marks a departure from conventional research approaches that solely focused on macroeconomic determinants while investigating patterns of renewable energy consumption. Thus, this research pursues to witness the relationship between the political risk index (PRI), renewable electricity output (RELOP), public-private partnership investment in energy (PPINENR), and renewable energy consumption (RECNS) in China from 1984 to 2022. For data estimations, this study utilizes time series methods, which include DF-GLS and Johansen cointegration for unit root and long-run equilibrium with FMOLS, DOLS and CCR as primary methods. The research also employs the least squares method with break years and robust least squares as robustness check methods while for causal relationships, we deploy the Granger causality approach. The outcomes assert that variables are found stationary at differences and long-run equilibrium is confirmed among variables. The empirical estimations predict that GDP and PPINENR reduce the RECNS in China in both short and long term. Furthermore, PRI and RELOP enhance renewable energy consumption in the short as well as long run. Therefore, policymakers should mostly focus on the encouraging role of PPINENR towards renewable electricity to enhance RECNS in developing economies, particularly in China. To achieve the targets of COP27, China should increase its focus on the efficient utilization of public-private partnership investments and also manage the political risks in the economy to promote renewable energy consumption and achieve a sustainable environment. Moreover, the causality analysis unearths that PRI could be utilized along with other variables to enhance RECNS in China. The robustness check asserts similar and robust outcomes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Emigration has been in the past of the European Continent and continues to be a significant feature in many countries of Eastern and South-Eastern Europe. The states of the Western Balkans have been interested in this phenomenon in a sustainable way in the last 20 years due to war, changes in economic systems, or political instability. In the various studies related to the effects of Remittances in the countries of origin, direct and positive impacts on GDP have been observed, but in other cases, these impacts are questioned since Remittances also mean that the workforce or human resources are not active in the country of origin and at the same time create a lack of GDP growth. For this reason, remittances and their fluctuations have never had a positive impact on the GDP of the countries of origin. The objective of this paper is to identify if there is a positive and direct impact between the level of remittances in relation to the Gross Domestic Product and economic growth for the five countries of the Western Balkans (Serbia, Bosnia Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Albania) during the period 2000-2021 with annual data according to World Bank data. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Using panel data for 12 Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries over the period of 2002 to 2020, the various estimates were carried out by the system generalised method of moments (GMM) method to examine the problem of endogeneity, and unobserved heterogeneity. The results indicate that migrant remittances have a direct negative link to economic growth due to it being mainly used for consumption. This increases the likelihood of dependency, which leads to the reduction of labour supply. The joint relationship between the governance composite index, and remittances, may moderate this negative effect on economic growth. However, considering the individual dimensions of governance, this shows that only the interaction between remittances and the control of corruption gives a positive and significant impact. The interaction between remittances and the five other governance quality indicators appears to be negative and insignificant. This shows that political instability, ineffective government, and poor regulatory quality encourages money transfer through informal channels that thwart economic growth in MENA countries. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

We examine this question in the context of the Arab Spring, which originated from Tunisia and Egypt in 2011 and soon spread through the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. We use a static fixed effects model and a dynamic GMM model on a panel of 14 MENA countries for the period 2006–2017 to identify the major socio-economic and political determinants of both non-violent and violent Arab Spring protests. One of the main findings of our article is that, in contrast with the “intermediate regimes hypothesis”, the intermediate regimes tend to be more stable compared to both strictly authoritarian and relatively democratic regimes. Further, more nuanced dimensions of democracy, in terms of institutional checks on the authoritarian regime, have a positive impact on stability and reducing protests. With regard to socio-economic factors, our results show that factors leading to better living standards, such as higher economic growth and higher levels of GDP per capita, and transfers in the form of public expenditure (“authoritarian bargain”) partly mitigate the grievances and the resulting protests. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Some of the SADC countries have undertaken serious economic and institutional reforms to encourage the inflow of FDI, particularly to low-income countries of the region, but these efforts have not so far led to the expected increases in investment: the overall amount of FDI remains low, it is concentrated in very few countries and mostly goes to the extraction of natural resources. Institutions and infrastructure development typically have a positive effect on FDI inflows as they improve investment climate. To examine their role in boosting the FDI flows to the SADC countries, the paper uses panel data econometric analysis with OLS and PCSE. Its results show that the quality of governance, together with the level of economic development, market size, and openness to international trade are the main factors that determine the amounts of FDI flowing into the SADC countries. For some areas, however, the primary need is to combat the rampant corruption and reduce political instability. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Significant energy initiatives within the context of the “Belt and Road” are characterized by substantial financial transactions, intricate technological complexities, and prolonged construction timelines. Furthermore, the array of risk factors involved is diverse and continuously in flux. To identify pivotal risk indicators in investment projects, we employ the ISM-MICMAC (interpretive structural modeling-matriced impacts corise-multiplication appliance classement) method. We integrate the Leaky Noisy-OR gate model and dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) to formulate a dynamic model depicting the evolution of investment risk. This model enables us to trace the path of risk evolution at various temporal nodes through forward and backward reasoning. In a practical application of our methodology, we conduct an empirical analysis focusing on the M5 thermal power station in Belarus. The study findings reveal the establishment of a multidimensional and all-encompassing index system. We identify primary factors contributing to project risk, notably including political instability and policy alterations. Additionally, we unveil the intricate interplay among risk factors within major energy projects and highlight specific risks at pivotal junctures in their development. Through the creation of a dynamic risk evolution model and the subsequent analysis of risk evolution paths, our work offers a foundational framework for conducting risk assessments and understanding the evolution of investments in energy projects within the Belt and Road initiative (BRI). The study’s findings have important policy implications for improving the management of risks associated with BRI major energy projects, including enhancing government macroeconomic policies, strengthening industry associations, and optimizing enterprise risk management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},
