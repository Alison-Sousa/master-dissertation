Abstract = {This study introduces the Worst Moth Disruption Strategy (WMFO) to
   enhance the Moth Fly Optimization (MFO) algorithm, specifically
   addressing challenges related to population stagnation and low
   diversity. The WMFO aims to prevent local trapping of moths, fostering
   improved global search capabilities. Demonstrating a remarkable
   efficiency of 66.6 \%, WMFO outperforms the MFO on CEC15 benchmark test
   functions. The Friedman and Wilcoxon tests further confirm WMFO's
   superiority over state-of-the-art algorithms. Introducing a hybrid
   model, WMFO-MLP, combining WMFO with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP),
   facilitates effective parameter tuning for carbon emission prediction,
   achieving an outstanding total accuracy of 97.8 \%. Comparative analysis
   indicates that the MLP-WMFO model surpasses alternative techniques in
   precision, reliability, and efficiency. Feature importance analysis
   reveals that variables such as Oil Efficiency and Economic Growth
   significantly impact MLP-WMFO's predictive power, contributing up to 40
   \%. Additionally, Gas Efficiency, Renewable Energy, Financial Risk, and
   Political Risk explain 26.5 \%, 13.6 \%, 8 \%, and 6.5 \%, respectively.
   Finally, WMFO-MLP performance offers advancements in optimization and
   predictive modeling with practical applications in carbon emission
   prediction.},

Title = {FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT IN UKRAINE: A PATHWAY TO SUSTAINABILITY},
Journal = {FINANCIAL AND CREDIT ACTIVITY-PROBLEMS OF THEORY AND PRACTICE},

Abstract = {The paper investigates the role of foreign direct investment (FDI) in
   the economic and infrastructure recovery of Ukraine, offering a
   comprehensive analysis of its drivers, trends, and future potential. The
   study identifies FDI as a critical driver for restoring economic
   stability and fostering sustainable development in Ukraine, particularly
   in light of the extensive destruction caused by the ongoing war. The aim
   of the paper is to investigate the role of foreign direct investment in
   economic recovery and war-affected infrastructure reconstruction in
   Ukraine for sustainable development. The methodology involves a
   multidimensional approach, incorporating quantitative analysis of FDI
   inflows and outflows from 2013 to 2023 in Ukraine, regulatory framework
   examination, correlation and regression analyses to identify key factors
   influencing FDI dynamics, forecasting and others. By analyzing,
   forecasting and comparing Ukraine's FDI trends with selected European
   countries, particularly in the context of geopolitical challenges and
   economic instability, the study provides a thorough understanding of the
   unique barriers and opportunities Ukraine faces in attracting FDI. The
   results reveal that FDI in Ukraine has been significantly influenced by
   political instability and the ongoing war, with inflows showing notable
   volatility. Despite these challenges, resilience in the economy has been
   demonstrated, driven by international financial support and domestic
   recovery efforts. The originality of this research lies in its focus on
   the specific context of post-war recovery in Ukraine, offering new
   insights into how FDI can serve as a catalyst for sustainable
   development. By identifying strategic areas for investment and
   addressing current legislative barriers, this study provides valuable
   contributions to the broader understanding of FDI's role in post-war
   economic recovery. Further research is required to refine analyses of
   factors, develop predictive models and explore emerging FDI trends as
   geopolitical conditions evolve.},

Title = {VOLATILITY IN GEORGIA, ITS INFLUENCE ON THE INVESTMENT DECISIONS OF
   MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR FOREIGN DIRECT
   INVESTMENT DYNAMICS IN THE COUNTRY},
Journal = {FINANCIAL AND CREDIT ACTIVITY-PROBLEMS OF THEORY AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2025},

Pages = {293-308},
Abstract = {Georgia's strategic location between Europe and Asia makes it a key
   destination for foreign direct investment (FDI). Since independence, the
   country has implemented economic reforms to enhance its business
   environment, including regulatory improvements, anti-corruption
   measures, and trade liberalization. Despite these efforts, Georgia faces
   political, economic, and social volatility, impacting investment
   decisions by multinational enterprises (MNEs). Political instability,
   including frequent government changes and regional tensions, creates
   uncertainty. Economic fluctuations in GDP growth, inflation, and
   exchange rates further complicate investment, while labour market
   concerns and social unrest add additional risks. Volatility can deter
   investment by increasing perceived risks, yet it also presents
   opportunities for MNEs adept at navigating uncertain environments. This
   study examines the relationship between Georgia's instability and MNE
   investment strategies, focusing on how political, economic, and social
   factors shape the investment climate. Political shifts influence
   regulatory frameworks, economic volatility affects profitability, and
   social instability impacts labour costs and operational efficiency. By
   analyzing macroeconomic data, political stability, and market
   conditions, this research explores how MNEs perceive and respond to risk
   in Georgia. It assesses volatility's sectoral impact and long-term
   consequences on FDI inflows, outflows, and distribution. The study
   contributes to international business literature by clarifying how
   volatility affects investment in emerging markets. It also offers
   recommendations for policymakers to enhance Georgia's investment appeal
   and for MNEs to develop effective risk mitigation strategies. Combining
   theoretical insights with empirical data, this research provides a
   nuanced understanding of volatility's role in shaping FDI dynamics.},

Title = {Chinese SMEs' location choice and political risk: The moderating role of
   legitimacy},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {33},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {International business studies show that multinational enterprises
   generally invest in locations with fewer political risks, but that this
   may not always apply to emerging -market multinational enterprises, due
   to the specific characteristics of their home countries. In this paper,
   we examine the impact of political risk on the location decisions of
   Chinese small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and explore the
   legitimacy of firms from China in different host countries as a
   moderator of the relationship between political risk and location
   choice. Our empirical investigation is based on an original database of
   617 foreign direct investment (FDI) location -choice decisions made by
   240 Chinese SMEs between 2006 and 2017. The results show that political
   risk deters Chinese SMEs from choosing certain locations, but political
   and economic legitimacy positively mitigate this relationship. Combining
   the political institutions approach and legitimacy -based view of
   political risk, we contribute novel insights into the role of legitimacy
   of firms from the same country of origin in emerging market SMEs `
   strategic choices of FDI location.},

Abstract = {Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) plays a crucial role in economic growth,
   particularly in fragile states like Somalia. Despite its strategic
   location and resource potential, Somalia faces challenges such as
   political instability, weak infrastructure, and climate vulnerabilities
   that deter investors. This study explores the economic and environmental
   determinants of FDI in Somalia, focusing on GDP growth, inflation,
   population growth, urbanization, rainfall, and temperature. Using
   time-series data and the ARDL model, it examines both the direct effects
   of these variables and the moderating role of GDP growth. Findings
   confirm a long-term relationship where GDP and population growth enhance
   FDI, while inflation and rising temperatures hinder investment. Rainfall
   positively influences FDI, reflecting its importance in Somalia's
   agriculture-dependent economy. Urbanization remains insignificant in the
   long run due to unplanned growth. In the short term, population growth,
   urbanization, and temperature significantly affect FDI, while GDP,
   inflation, and rainfall show weaker immediate effects. The moderation
   analysis suggests that GDP growth mitigates climate-related investment
   risks. This study underscores the need for economic stability,
   infrastructure development, and climate adaptation strategies to attract
   sustainable FDI and promote long-term growth in Somalia.},

Abstract = {PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of
   political instability at the local level on foreign firms in China.
   Building on the literature on political embeddedness and business power,
   the authors propose a theoretical framework to explain how political
   turnover can affect foreign firms' performance and how they respond to
   such challenges by leveraging their power
   bases.Design/methodology/approachTo test the hypotheses, the authors
   apply fixed effects regression to an unbalanced panel data set
   comprising 13,360 foreign firms from 1998 to 2013 and the political
   replacement that involved changes in provincial governors.FindingsThe
   findings confirm that political turnover incidents have a negative
   impact on the performance of foreign firms in China. However, the
   authors also found that this negative relationship is weaker for firms
   that can choose various types of power sources. Specifically, the study
   reveals that foreign firms with large firm size, government ownership
   and a strong foreign direct investment community are better qualified to
   mitigate the negative effects of political
   instability.Originality/valueThis study contributes to the literature by
   developing the understanding of how political uncertainties and risks
   affect the performance of foreign firms in China and the importance of
   firms' power in counterbalancing these effects. The research provides
   valuable insights into how multinational corporations can exploit their
   power to manage the effects of local political turnover, which has
   practical implications for the strategy and management of foreign firms
   operating in China.},

Abstract = {Outward Foreign Direct Investment (OFDI) provides construction
   enterprises with opportunities for market expansion and resource
   generation. However, effective risk prevention and control are crucial
   for maximizing returns, presenting unique challenges in the construction
   industry. This study explores these complexities and underscores the
   importance of robust risk management. It introduces an innovative risk
   warning model that integrates cluster analysis, Bayesian optimization,
   and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) to establish a
   macro-medium-micro OFDI risk indicator system. Unsupervised K-means++
   clustering enables three-dimensional risk level classification, while
   the BO-XGBoost machine learning model enhances accuracy, stability, and
   interpretability. Validation using a dataset of 154 samples from a
   decade of OFDI by Chinese listed construction companies demonstrates the
   model's superior performance compared to existing machine learning
   approaches. This research advances OFDI risk management by addressing
   the specific challenges faced by construction enterprises worldwide.},

Title = {The growth-environment nexus amid geopolitical risks: cointegration and
   machine learning algorithm approaches},
Journal = {DISCOVER SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {6},

Month = {FEB 7},
Abstract = {Geopolitical tensions, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, ongoing
   Middle-Eastern wars, and the post-Cold War dynamics between the USA and
   Russia, have contributed to significant global political instability.
   These risks disrupt economic growth, destabilize energy supply chains,
   and foster economic uncertainty, often prioritizing energy security over
   environmental sustainability. Existing literature inadequately addresses
   how geopolitical risks interact with environmental sustainability,
   particularly within developed economies like Canada. To bridge this gap,
   this study examines the role of per capita income on environmental
   outcomes under the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) framework,
   explicitly incorporating geopolitical risks as a critical determinant.
   Using Canadian time series data spanning from 1980 to 2022, this
   research employs the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) estimation
   technique to explore short- and long-term cointegrating relationships
   among key variables, including economic growth, energy consumption,
   trade openness, foreign direct investment (FDI), ICT development, and
   financial development. The findings confirm the inverted U-shaped EKC
   hypothesis for Canada, indicating that economic growth initially
   exacerbates carbon emissions (CO2) before leading to environmental
   improvements at higher income levels. Geopolitical risks are found to
   positively contribute to CO2 emissions, emphasizing their role as a
   barrier to achieving environmental sustainability. To validate
   robustness, the Kernel Regularized Least Squares (KRLS) machine learning
   approach is employed, confirming the consistency of results.
   Additionally, the Toda-Yamamoto causality test identifies directional
   causal relationships among the variables. Policy recommendations
   emphasize the need for Canada to implement targeted strategies that
   mitigate the impact of geopolitical risks on environmental outcomes.
   Specifically, the study advocates for: (1) diversifying energy sources
   to reduce reliance on geopolitically sensitive regions, (2) investing in

Abstract = {Incumbents who resort to violence in efforts to secure their hold on
   power have been a major challenge for sub-Saharan Africa. At the same
   time, opening up domestic markets to international capital in the form
   of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has provided governments with more
   resources to garner the support of their citizens. How are these
   developments related? We argue that FDI reduces the likelihood that
   incumbents use violence in competitive regions. FDI has direct economic
   benefits for the population. Especially in competitive regions, where
   violence might reduce turnout even among their potential supporters,
   incumbents thus adapt their re-election strategies and use fewer violent
   means. We draw on geo-referenced data on election violence, FDI, and
   previous election results and match these within subnational regions.
   Investigating subnational variation in 15 sub-Saharan African countries,
   we find empirical support for our argument. FDI lowers pre-election
   violence in competitive regions, but has no effect in both incumbent and
   opposition strongholds. These findings are robust to using 10x10 km and
   25x25 km grid cells and have important implications for democratic
   countries' foreign policies: allowing multinational companies to invest

Title = {The Relationship between Trade Openness and FDI Inflows: Evidence-Based
   Insights from ASEAN Region},
Journal = {ECONOMIES},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This research paper focuses on figuring out the impact of trade openness
   on FDI inflows, which has received relatively less attention in the
   literature, specifically in the context of ASEAN economies. The ASEAN
   region, which is relatively more open in terms of both trade openness as
   well as FDI inflows, is chosen as a sample. Annual data are gathered
   from ``World Development Indicators (WDI){''} and ``World Governance
   Indicators (WGI){''}. Reported results and findings are based on ``Fixed
   Effect (FE) Modeling{''}, and the ``Generalized Least Square (GLS){''}
   is utilized for the robustness check. The results indicated that trade
   openness matters significantly for attracting FDI inflows. Similarly,
   institutional quality has also exerted a positive and significant
   influence on the inflows of FDI. The disaggregated analysis shows that
   five aspects of institutional quality, such as rule of law, regulatory
   quality, control of corruption, voice and accountability, and political
   instability and absence of violence, have positively and significantly
   impacted the FDI inflows in the case of selected ASEAN economies. The
   results demonstrated that exchange rate depreciation is harmful for the
   inflows of FDI. Moreover, FDI inflows responded positively to market
   size. Furthermore, the results showed that the impact of natural
   resources and inflation on FDI inflows is insignificant statistically.
   The present study suggests that the ASEAN policymakers manage their
   exchange rate effectively, improve the quality of institutions, and
   adopt vigorous trade liberalization policies to attract more FDI
   inflows.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the risks associated with Chinese developers'
   outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) in the Malaysian real estate
   sector. Adopting a mixed- methods approach integrating quantitative
   surveys and qualitative interviews, the study comprehensively identifies
   and analyzes various political, legal, economic, social, environmental,
   and home country risks. Key findings reveal that the COVID-19 pandemic,
   China's foreign exchange control policies, and political instability in
   Malaysia are the most critical risk factors. As a novel contribution,
   the study develops an adaptive risk management framework tailored
   specifically for international real estate projects, with strategies
   focused on active political engagement, financial diversification, legal
   adaptation, cultural integration, and a focus on environmental
   sustainability. This framework aims to enhance the resilience and
   profitability of Chinese developers in the Malaysian real estate sector,
   offering actionable insights for developers, investors, and
   policymakers.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study is to analyze the impact of economic freedom
   and the development of international tourism on international trade,
   encompassing exports, imports, and total trade. The research sample
   includes 22 Asian countries over the period from 1995 to 2020. The study
   employs the System Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) for estimating
   the research models. Results indicate that economic freedom, business
   freedom, and trade freedom play a crucial role in international trade
   activities (both exports and imports). Furthermore, the development of
   international tourism also demonstrates a significantly positive impact
   on trade (both exports and imports). The study suggests that policies
   towards economic openness, increasing economic freedom, business
   freedom, and trade freedom should be carefully considered and promoted
   within the trade developmentstrategies of nations. Additionally,
   economic policies should also focus on solutions to attract
   international tourists not only as a source of foreign currency but also
   as a support to foster the development of trade.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the link between political instability and economic
   growth in 34 advanced economies from 1996 to 2020. First, we use a panel
   VAR estimated via the System GMM to explore the endogenous relationship
   between economic growth and political instability and identify
   transmission channels. Second, we employ an instrumental variable
   approach, exploiting temperature variation and spillover effects of
   political instability to establish causality. The results of both
   approaches indicate that a one-standard deviation shock of political
   instability significantly and substantially reduces economic output. We
   find no evidence, however, that economic growth affects political
   instability.},

Title = {The Impact of Wealth Inequality on Economic Growth: A Machine Learning
   Approach},
Journal = {COMPUTATIONAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 MAR 11},
Abstract = {In recent years, the issue of increasing economic inequality in both
   advanced and emerging economies has garnered considerable focus,
   sparking numerous debates in economic and political circles. At the
   heart of social science inquiries is the critical question of whether
   economic inequality acts as a catalyst for or an obstacle to economic
   growth. This study explores the impact of wealth inequality on economic
   growth considering heterogeneity of the countries. Utilizing advanced
   datasets and cutting-edge machine learning techniques to address the
   nonlinear dynamics of this relationship, our analysis provides a nuanced
   departure from traditional panel data models. Our findings indicate that
   the impact of wealth inequality on economic growth is heterogeneous,
   contingent upon a country's economic structure and existing level of
   inequality. Specifically, while a moderate level of inequality may
   stimulate growth in developed and pre-communist countries, it tends to
   impede growth in developing and underdeveloped countries with higher
   degrees of economic inequality. Our research further elucidates the
   presence of an inverted U-shaped relationship between wealth inequality
   and growth, identifying an optimal inequality threshold beyond which the
   adverse effects-such as diminished access to education and increased
   social unrest-surpass the potential benefits.},

Title = {Determinants of multinationals' foreign divestment strategies: Evidence
   from Russia},
Journal = {UPRAVLENETS-THE MANAGER},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Unprecedented economic sanctions are among key factors behind investment
   strategies employed by multinational corporations (MNCs) for doing
   business in Russia. Challenges faced by the host economy and pressure
   from home countries are pushing international investors towards
   alternative strategies of equity participation. Despite the mass exit of
   Western businesses in 2022, the dilemma of leaving or staying in the
   Russian market is still acute for many MNCs. The purpose of the article
   is to identify factors affecting foreign investment companies' intention
   to continue or curtail their operations in the sanctioned Russian
   economy and the choice among strategic alternatives as to exit or keep
   their business in the country. Political risk theory, economic
   opportunism theory and the emerging concept of foreign divestment
   constitute the methodological basis of the study. Econometric modelling
   of MNCs'decisions in the host economy is carried out using binary and
   multiple choice models. The empirical evidence is comprised of data for
   2022 on corporate decisions of 1,359 subsidiaries located in Russia. The
   research results showed that, despite political pressure, economic
   success of Russian business units drives foreign investors to continue
   operating in the sanctioned economy. Growing revenues and share of the
   Russian branch in the MNC consolidated income raise the likelihood that
   the subsidiary will remain in the Russian market or take a wait-and-see
   position. We have found that the crowd effect and the snowball effect do
   not increase, but decrease the likelihood of foreign divestment from
   Russia, as does the different perception of corruption between Russia
   and the MNC's home country. Our findings contribute to the understanding
   of global supply chain sustainability, strategies for attracting foreign
   direct investment and finding new business partners for Russian
   companies in the current geopolitical situation.},

Title = {Integrating machine learning and econometric models to uncover
   macroeconomic determinants of renewable energy production in the
   selected European countries},

Abstract = {The transition to renewable energy is a strategic priority across
   Europe, yet limited attention has been paid to the macroeconomic and
   institutional determinants of renewable energy production (REP).
   Understanding these factors is essential for crafting effective and
   resilient energy policies, particularly in a region characterized by
   diverse economic and governance contexts. This study investigates the
   drivers of REP in 26 European countries from 1995 to 2022, integrating
   panel econometric analysis with machine learning forecasting.
   Driscoll-Kraay Standard Errors (DKSE) and Fixed Effects (FE) models are
   compared, with DKSE preferred due to its ability to address
   heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation, and cross-sectional dependence. In
   addition, five machine learning models-including Random Forest, Support
   Vector Machine, CNN-BiLSTM-AR, LSTM, and ARIMA-are used to evaluate
   forecasting accuracy. The results identify research and development
   (R\&D) expenditure as a dominant positive driver of REP, while political
   instability and weak rule of law significantly hinder progress.
   Macroeconomic variables such as GDP, inflation, population, and
   financial development also influence REP to varying degrees. Among
   forecasting models, Random Forest achieves the highest predictive
   accuracy across most countries, validating the role of data-driven
   approaches in energy planning. These findings underscore the importance
   of stable governance, targeted innovation support, and macroeconomic
   stability in promoting renewable energy production, providing
   policymakers in Europe with timely insights for achieving sustainable
   energy transitions.},

Abstract = {The aim of our paper was to construct a model of economic growth
   determinants for old and new EU and the EU28 countries. We used a
   strongly balanced panel in the period from 2000 to 2020 and regression
   equations. For the old EU group, our results showed a high level of
   statistical significance and a positive effect of gross fixed capital
   formation, trade openness, government consumption, and population on GDP
   growth during the observation period. In the new EU group, trade
   openness, political stability, and government consumption are
   significant and positively affect economic growth. When we included the
   moment of accession of new EU members in the analysis, our results
   showed that gross fixed capital formation, trade openness, political
   stability, and government consumption had a statistically significant
   and positive influence on the GDP growth rate. Interestingly, our
   results did not confirm the expected positive impact of foreign direct
   investments and renewable energy consumption on economic growth in our
   sample countries. We found that the crisis is statistically significant
   and negatively affected the GDP growth rate in both groups with a
   stronger impact in new EU countries. We conclude our article with policy
   implications and recommendations for future research.},

Title = {Connectedness Between Government Expenditure and Economic Growth in the
   UK: Evidence from Wavelet Approach},
Journal = {COMPUTATIONAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 MAY 2},
Abstract = {This study aims to provide a vigorous vision of the connectedness of
   government health and education investments as a share of government
   expenditure with economic growth given political and/or economic risk
   through wavelet methodology. The empirical analyses are carried out
   through multiple and partial wavelet coherence techniques employing
   quarterly data from 1984Q1 and 2021Q4. To the best of the author's
   knowledge, there is no study in related literature investigating the
   connectedness between human capital investment of government and
   economic growth considering the level of political and economic risk
   within the country through wavelet tools. Therefore, the main
   contribution of this study is to fill this gap both in academic
   literature and the policy arena. According to the empirical outcomes,
   the strongest connectedness exists between economic growth and
   government health investment until 2013. However, from 2018, it has been
   observed that economic risk and economic growth connectedness are
   stronger in the short and medium run, as in the case of the UK.},

Title = {Macroeconomic effects of political instability in the WAEMU: an analysis

Journal = {COGENT ECONOMICS \& FINANCE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {This article analyses the macroeconomic effects of political instability
   through the efficiency of domestic investment in the countries of the
   West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). The estimation method
   considered in this analysis is the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL)
   method. The analysis uses panel data covering the period from 2002 to
   2021. This work differs from previous work because it captures the
   efficiency of investment using the incremental capital output ratio
   (ICOR) which is appropriate for low-income countries. In addition, this
   work takes into account the long-run view that is appropriate for
   macroeconomic analysis of political instability. The results reveal
   that, in the long term, political instability reduces the efficiency of
   domestic investment, public investment and private investment. The
   results suggest that the macroeconomic efficiency of domestic investment
   should be sought by combating political violence, government instability
   and internal conflicts, which are three key indicators of political
   instability. The results also suggest that emphasis should be placed on
   protecting private investment, which is more vulnerable than public
   investment in the context of political instability in the WAEMU.},

Abstract = {While prior studies have examined corruption, political instability, and
   climate change separately, few have explored their combined impact on
   economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This study pioneers an
   integrated analysis of how institutional quality, climate stress, and
   economic growth interact in the region. Using System GMM and long-run
   multiplier methods on data from 43 SSA countries (1996-2019), the
   findings show that strong institutions enhance resilience but cannot
   fully offset the economic costs of rising temperatures. Corruption and
   political instability weaken climate governance, increase CO2 emissions,
   and exacerbate growth challenges, while emissions-intensive growth
   undermines institutional gains. By revealing institutions' dual role as
   both a buffer and a vulnerability in the climate-economy nexus, this
   study advances knowledge and emphasizes the urgent need for integrated
   institutional reforms and climate adaptation policies to safeguard
   sustainable growth in SSA.},

Title = {How business environment of countries along the Belt and Road impacts
   China's OFDI efficiency: a stochastic frontier gravity model approach},

Abstract = {The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) provides a new opportunity for the
   continued deepening of economic and trade cooperation between China and
   countries along the BRI route. However, different business environments
   among countries have led to the problem of a low and uneven distribution
   of China's overall trade and investment efficiency in the countries
   along the route. Using the stochastic frontier gravity model, this study
   evaluates the efficiency of China's outward foreign direct investment
   (OFDI) based on the data of 47 countries along the Belt and Road route
   from 2013 to 2019. The empirical results indicate that the efficiency
   level of China's OFDI in countries located along the Belt and Road route
   is 43.39\%, which suggests a regional imbalance. In terms of business
   environment factors, regulatory governance, civic discourse, government
   accountability, and regulatory quality in host countries have a positive
   impact on China's OFDI. The positive effects of the BRI have enabled
   Chinese enterprises to better face factors such as political
   instability, corruption and imperfections in the legal system when
   investing abroad. The findings and suggestions could help the
   governments and enterprises of the countries along the route improve the
   business environment in a more targeted manner, enhance the space for
   economic and trade cooperation, and promote the common development of
   the countries along the route.},

Title = {Political and financial risks in developing countries: Implications for
   energy security and the transition to renewable energy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {387},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This study investigates the impact of political and financial risks on
   energy security (ES) and renewable energy adoption (REA) in developing
   countries. Utilizing a dynamic panel data approach with the Generalized
   Method of Moments (GMM) estimator, we assess how these risks influence
   various indicators of energy security and renewable energy investment
   across 36 developing countries from 1990 to 2022. Our empirical findings
   reveal that reducing political and financial risks enhances energy
   security and facilitates the transition to renewable energy sources.
   Lower political risk creates a stable environment conducive to long-term
   investments in the energy sector, while reduced financial risk lowers
   the cost of capital, making large-scale energy projects more feasible.
   The interaction of these risks fosters investor confidence, attracts
   foreign direct investment, and promotes innovation and competition
   within the energy sector. Additionally, GDP growth and trade openness
   positively impact ES and REA by providing financial resources and
   enabling the exchange of advanced technologies. However, high human
   capital levels may increase energy consumption due to greater economic
   activity and higher living standards, posing challenges to energy
   security and the renewable transition. These insights offer valuable
   policy recommendations for enhancing energy security and promoting
   sustainable energy transitions in politically and financially volatile
   environments.},

Title = {Making Sense of Socio-Political Risks in International Business: A
   Configurational Approach to Embracing Complexity},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {30},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {As social and political contexts have become major sources of
   uncertainty for international business, we have witnessed renewed
   efforts to study the impact of socio-political risks on multinational
   enterprises. However, predominant methods in the field of international
   business are, for the most part, limited in their capacity to directly
   address the complexity intrinsic to socio-political risks. We propose
   overcoming this limitation by adopting a configurational approach that
   enables researchers to embrace the complexity of socio-political risks
   in international business. We explain the fundamental principles of a
   configurational approach and the typical stages for using its
   methodological tool, Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). We then
   outline how scholars can use QCA to pursue future research avenues that
   identify the configurations of conditions that constitute
   socio-political risks or the effects of socio-political risks on diverse
   outcomes of interest. We also clarify how the international business
   field can benefit from the use of QCA in the study of socio-political
   risks by advancing knowledge of international business in emerging and
   informal markets, where data access is limited. These efforts aim to
   motivate international business and management scholars to broaden their
   empirical toolbox for the study of socio-political risks by engaging in
   configurational thinking and theorizing.},

Abstract = {In the empirical determination of the factors influencing the clean
   energy transition, the BRICS economies have initiated various policy
   reforms, such as increased R\&D budgets, improvements in technology and
   political stability. This study analyses the critical role of political
   risk and economic growth, natural resources, research and development
   and technological innovation in the clean energy transition in the
   period 1990-2022. Using panel econometric approaches, this study
   confirms the heterogeneity of slopes and cross-sectional dependence.
   Using linear regression with the heteroscedastic panel-corrected
   standard error approach, the results show that economic expansion,
   political risk and the quadratic R\&D term significantly enhance the
   clean energy transition. However, natural resources, conventional
   technological innovation and research and development expenditures are
   the leading barriers to a clean energy transition in the region. The
   robustness of these results is validated by a series of panel
   regressions. Following the empirical outcomes, this study recommends
   rapid enhancement of the research and development budget, strengthening
   of governance and institutions and investment in technological
   innovation to attain a sustainable transition towards clean energy
   sources.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a concept of grassroots socio-political risk
   (SPR) and provide a measure for it that is based on individual-level
   Google Trends data that captures issue salience. Our concept provides a
   bottom-up complement to established measures that focus more on
   political and institutional players and the institutional constraints
   they face. Our grassroots SPR index attempts to capture public pressure
   to initiate institutional change in a country. In contrast to existing
   measures, our Google Trends-based measure captures issue salience
   directly among individuals rather than media or analyst reports. As
   such, it is uniquely representative of sociopolitical sentiment, timely,
   and widely available. Our concept and measure offer international
   business (IB) researchers novel opportunities. In addition to developing
   the index, we scrutinize its validity and provide an illustrative
   empirical application in the IB context by showing that differences
   between internal and external assessments of grassroots SPR are
   contingent on psychic distance.},

Abstract = {This article examines the development of offshore commercial and
   financial services in tax havens between 1955-1979. The geographic locus
   of this paper is the Caribbean region, mainly focusing on the island tax
   havens that had been part of the British empire prior to decolonization.
   The article examines the relationship between the development of tax
   havens and decolonisation, and explores questions of international
   capital movement, the institutional structure of tax havens, the
   development of banking and commercial services in tax havens, and other
   offshore business activities. The article presents new data on
   international capital investment and capital movement, and provides
   empirical evidence in relation to the structure and function of
   businesses located in tax havens. This evidence is used to engage with
   emerging debates with reference to the history of tax havens:
   specifically, the nature of capital movement and the importance of
   beneficial ownership rights, and the relationship between the
   (re)location of business to tax havens and the mitigation of political
   risk and instability. We demonstrate that the development of tax havens
   in this period was a consequence of substantial innovation by business
   and finance to create advantageous environmental conditions in relation
   to taxation and governance. This was supported by an isomorphic process
   that spread similarly favourable regimes of law and regulation between
   different tax havens, as well as the development of a range of
   supportive commercial and financial services. We conclude by discussing
   the implications for future research on this topic.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the relationship between political instability
   and bank liquidity. Next, we investigate the possible transmission
   channels through which political instability impacts bank liquidity
   negatively. Also, we examine whether the environmental performance of
   banks could mitigate the effects of political instability towards bank
   liquidity. We employ a panel data set comprising 112 banks in 19 Asian
   countries from 2013 to 2023. Using the fixed effects, two-step system
   GMM and two-stage least squares estimation techniques, our findings show
   that political instability significantly reduces bank liquidity. We show
   that the impact of political instability is less pronounced in banks
   with high environmental performance. Our results are robust to
   alternative definitions of bank liquidity, specifications, and address
   endogeneity concerns. We present novel evidence that `depositor
   attitude' and `interbank liabilities' are the two possible transmission
   channels through which political instability negatively impacts bank
   liquidity. We find no support for the liquidity buffer constraint. Our
   findings extend flight-to-liquidity and bank lending theories by
   highlighting how political instability impacts bank liquidity and enrich
   the risk management theory by demonstrating the role of environmental
   performance in mitigating the impact of political instability on banks.},

Abstract = {In today's rapidly evolving world, the transition towards green energy
   remains momentous in attaining ecological sustainability. In this
   respect, the present study intends to elucidate factors influencing the
   green energy transition in OECD economies from 2004 to 2020. We use
   several diagnostic measures to validate the heterogeneity of slopes and
   cross-sectional dependence in the panel. Nevertheless, cointegration
   exists between the study variables, such as green energy, political
   risk, economic risk, financial risk, human capital, eco-innovation and
   energy efficiency. Using fixed effect and random effect approaches, we
   conclude that political risk, human capital and energy efficiency are
   significant and leading drivers of green energy transition in the
   region. However, economic expansion, financial risk and economic risk
   are significant barriers to transitioning towards green energy in the
   selected economies. The outcomes are robust, as authenticated by linear
   regression with a heteroskedastic panel-corrected standard error
   approach. We recommend the minimization of political, financial and
   economic risk, while improvements in environment-related R\&D investment
   could further boost the transition process towards green energy.},

Title = {The interactive effect of geopolitical risk and natural resource rent on
   political instability: Evidence from Ghana},

Abstract = {BackgroundAccording to economists, political instability is regarded as
   a serious malaise harmful to economic development, which results in
   frequent switches of policies, creating instability to impede economic
   performance. The widespread political instability in many developing
   countries, along with its harmful effects on social welfare and economic
   performance, has heightened the interest of policymakers and economists
   in understanding the factors that contribute to political instability to
   inform better policy formulation. It is therefore imperative to examine
   the interactive effect of geopolitical risk and natural resource rent on
   political instability to provide strong empirical grounds for policy
   implementation.ObjectivesThis study employs a long time series dating
   from the period of 1824-2020 to examine how natural resource rent and
   geopolitical risk influence political instability in Ghana. First, we
   examine long-run effects using linear methods. Second, we employ
   nonparametric methods to investigate the nonlinear link between natural
   resource rent and political instability as well as between geopolitical
   risk and political instability.MethodsThe study applied linear methods
   and nonparametric methods to historical time series data dating from the
   period of 1824-2020.ResultsThe results from the linear methods show that
   the interaction of natural resource rent and geopolitical risk exerts a
   positive and larger impact on political instability compared to their
   separate effects. The results from the nonparametric methods show a weak
   nonlinear link between these variables (i.e., natural resource rent,
   geopolitical risk, and political instability), although consistent with
   the linear long-run results, the links are positive.ConclusionOverall,
   the results demonstrate that the observed positive relationship between
   natural resource rent and political instability is not just a recent
   phenomenon but holds for over more than 100 years in Ghana. Therefore,
   to attain a stable political environment, both long- and short-term
   policies on political stability should be formulated.},

Abstract = {Using machine-learning-based measures for political and climate risks
   derived from corporate conference calls, we discover a link between the
   two in a large sample of US firms from 2002 to 2021. Our findings
   suggest that firms facing higher political risk are more susceptible to
   climate risk. Additionally, we find that a firm's emitter category
   industry classification and exposure to environmental litigation can
   exacerbate this situation, while managerial ability helps reduce the
   impact. Furthermore, political lobbying and donations effectively check
   corporate climate risk, but only under non-partisan conditions.
   Importantly, our findings are robust to concerns of reverse causality,
   sample selection bias, and measurement errors.},

Title = {Evaluating the Evolution of Investment Risks in Belt and Road Energy
   Projects: A Case Study of Belarus' M5 Thermal Power Station},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {2024},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Significant energy initiatives within the context of the ``Belt and
   Road{''} are characterized by substantial financial transactions,
   intricate technological complexities, and prolonged construction
   timelines. Furthermore, the array of risk factors involved is diverse
   and continuously in flux. To identify pivotal risk indicators in
   investment projects, we employ the ISM-MICMAC (interpretive structural
   modeling-matriced impacts corise-multiplication appliance classement)
   method. We integrate the Leaky Noisy-OR gate model and dynamic Bayesian
   network (DBN) to formulate a dynamic model depicting the evolution of
   investment risk. This model enables us to trace the path of risk
   evolution at various temporal nodes through forward and backward
   reasoning. In a practical application of our methodology, we conduct an
   empirical analysis focusing on the M5 thermal power station in Belarus.
   The study findings reveal the establishment of a multidimensional and
   all-encompassing index system. We identify primary factors contributing
   to project risk, notably including political instability and policy
   alterations. Additionally, we unveil the intricate interplay among risk
   factors within major energy projects and highlight specific risks at
   pivotal junctures in their development. Through the creation of a
   dynamic risk evolution model and the subsequent analysis of risk
   evolution paths, our work offers a foundational framework for conducting
   risk assessments and understanding the evolution of investments in
   energy projects within the Belt and Road initiative (BRI). The study's
   findings have important policy implications for improving the management
   of risks associated with BRI major energy projects, including enhancing
   government macroeconomic policies, strengthening industry associations,
   and optimizing enterprise risk management.},

Abstract = {The humanitarian aviation supply chain (HASC) serves as a critical
   conduit for delivering essential aid to populations affected by
   disasters and conflicts, especially when ground routes are inaccessible.
   However, HASCs operate in high-risk environments marked by instability,
   infrastructure damage, and operational challenges. Existing risk
   assessment approaches often struggle to account for the complex
   interdependencies among the many factors influencing mission success and
   supply chain resilience. This study introduces a comprehensive risk
   analysis framework for HASCs using Bayesian networks (BNs). The BN model
   integrates data on factors such as political instability, infrastructure
   damage, adverse weather, crew fatigue, and aircraft maintenance. Through
   quantitative analysis, the framework identifies critical vulnerabilities
   and assesses the likelihood of mission failure.},

Journal = {FINANCIAL INNOVATION},

Abstract = {Political instability has increased drastically in Pakistan during the
   last few decades. This may intensify the fear of investors and
   eventually affect investment decisions. Therefore, the stock market's
   reaction to political stability must be explored and appropriate policy
   measures should be prescribed. This paper examines the effect of
   political stability on stock market returns and volatility using time
   series data from Pakistan for the period from January 02, 2004, to May
   31, 2018. The study uses the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional
   Heteroskedastic (GARCH) and Exponential Generalized Autoregressive
   Conditional Heteroskedastic (EGARCH) models to achieve the main
   objectives. The findings of the GARCH and EGARCH models confirm that
   political stability has a positive and significant influence on both
   stock market returns and volatility in Pakistan. In addition, the EGARCH
   findings indicate that negative shock (political instability) creates
   more volatility in the stock market than positive shock (political
   stability). The results of this study reveal that financial market
   investors are affected more by political instability. In conclusion,
   this study suggests that political stability is an essential factor
   affecting financial market volatility, and it leads to stable financial
   markets. It also emphasizes that political instability needs to be
   resolved to achieve stable financial markets.},

Abstract = {Income inequality is an essential cause of violence, stagnant
   development, and political instability. This study will examine the
   positive and negative shocks in tourism development, and the
   distribution of the interaction between tourism development, economic
   growth, human capital, globalization, and income inequality will be
   discussed in Singapore, a developed and top-visited country. By adopting
   autoregressive distributed lag and non-linear autoregressive distributed
   lag approaches for panel data from 1978 to 2022, the results indicate an
   asymmetric cointegration among variables, and positive and negative
   changes in tourism development lead to decreased income inequality. More
   specifically, the asymmetric effect of tourism is found both in the
   short- and long-term, and positive shock has a greater impact than
   negative shock. At the same time, the findings also reveal that economic
   growth and globalization enhance, while human capital negatively affects
   income inequality in Singapore. These findings strengthen the belief of
   Singapore policy-makers and recommend several significant lessons for
   developing countries to promote tourism, sustainable development, and
   reduce income inequality.},

Title = {Economic freedom index effects on inbound tourism in European countries:
   A spatial analysis},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Despite the significance of economic freedom in tourism dynamics,
   especially from a spatial standpoint, its nuanced influence remains
   unexplored mainly in current research. To fill this gap, our study
   introduces a novel spatial panel data analysis to investigate how
   various components of the economic freedom index affect tourist arrivals
   in 41 European countries from 2005 to 2018. By employing this innovative
   approach, we uncover the complex interdependencies between economic
   freedom and tourism and highlight the significance of regional economic
   characteristics on the tourism sector's health. Our findings reveal that
   a one percent increase in GDP per capita of neighboring nations
   corresponds to a 0.4 percent increase in tourist arrivals to the home
   country. In comparison, a similar rise in neighboring countries' prices
   leads to a 0.4 percent decrease in inbound tourists. Most economic
   freedom variables, including the Business Freedom Index, Investment
   Freedom Index, Labor Freedom Index, Trade Freedom Index, and Government
   Integrity Index, demonstrate statistically significant positive effects.
   However, a one percent increase in the Monetary Freedom Index of
   neighboring countries results in a 0.747 percent reduction in homebound
   tourists. Notably, enhancements in the country's and neighboring
   countries' Investment Freedom Index and Government Integrity Index
   contribute to increased arrivals. This research contributes to the
   broader understanding of economic policies' impact on tourism, offering
   valuable insights for policymakers aiming to leverage economic freedom
   for tourism development. The application of a spatial panel data
   approach marks a significant methodological advancement in tourism
   studies, opening new avenues for analyzing economic influences on
   tourism at a regional level.},

Abstract = {This note describes the motivation, structure, and use of the Creating
   Emerging Markets (CEM) oral history -based project at the Harvard
   Business School. The project consists of lengthy interviews with
   business leaders from emerging markets. By June 2024, 183 interviews had
   been conducted with business leaders in 34 countries in Africa, Asia,
   the Middle East, and Latin America. Selected interviewees needed at
   least three decades of experience in business, and they must be assessed
   as highly impactful. The CEM project was conceived from the beginning as
   a public goods project. The transcripts of interviews are fully
   accessible on the project website. They can be downloaded by anyone with
   an internet connection, and they can be used in research and teaching
   without permission. The note goes on to explain how the CEM database has
   been employed in multiple academic publications, targeted at both
   historical and management audiences, and employing multiple
   methodologies. Examples include a study of gender and skin color
   stereotypes in the film industries in India, a comparison of how
   businesses perceived political risk in Latin America and South Asia, an
   analysis of business investment in education, and a study of spiritual
   philanthropy in emerging markets. Multiple methodologies have been
   employed including coding and the application of machine learning to
   undertake facial and text analysis of CEM interviews. (c) 2024 The

Title = {Coordinated Development of Forests and Society: Insights and Lessons
   from Natural Forest Restoration and Regional Development in China},
Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Mitigating and avoiding social unrest caused by ecological forest
   restoration is a key factor in the coordinated development of forests
   and society. Forests, which are intricately linked with society, serve
   as a vital source of timber, non-timber forest products, and ecosystem
   services. Ecological forest restoration projects must carefully consider
   the relationship between forests and society to promote their
   coordinated development. As a key implementation area for the Natural
   Forest Resource Protection Project, the state-owned forest regions in
   Northeast China have experienced a crisis regarding harvestable
   resources and social unrest caused by protection policies and are
   currently innovating in policies and practices to mitigate social
   unrest. This study focuses on the history of natural forest resource
   conservation projects in China's state-owned forest areas as a case
   study for empirical research, aiming to provide insights into ecological
   restoration models that foster harmony between forests and society. The
   empirical analyses reveal the following findings: (1) As a result of
   strict protection, natural forest resources on state-owned land have
   transitioned from providing timber to ecosystem services and non-timber
   products. (2) The strict logging ban policy has led to severe resource
   shortages; from 2000 to 2020, for every 10,000 cubic meter decrease in
   timber harvest, the per capita output in state-owned forest areas has
   dropped by more than CNY 500 (approximately USD 70). (3) Proactive
   ecological restoration can effectively alleviate social unrest; from
   2000 to 2020, for every additional 10,000 hectares of forest tending,
   the average wage increased by more than CNY 900 (approximately USD 127).
   (4) Regional transformation can effectively generate a buffer effect to
   mitigate social unrest caused by strict forest protection policies and
   leverage the beneficial resources produced by ecological forest
   restoration to develop new drivers of economic growth. By systematically
   reviewing the comprehensive implementation of the NFPP, this paper's
   findings provide insights into ecological restoration strategies that
   promote the harmonious development of forests and society.},

Title = {The impact of country risk on nickel supply chain: based on complex
   network and panel regression analysis},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Nickel is an important key resource and plays an increasingly important
   role in new energy technologies. The stability of its worldwide supply
   chain is crucial for addressing country risks and unforeseen events. To
   explore the impact of country risks on the stability of the global
   nickel supply chain, this study conducts a complex network analysis and
   panel regression analysis on nickel ore, ferro-nickel, and the
   stainless-steel trade data from 2000 to 2022. The study reveals the
   mechanisms by which economic and political risks affect the trade
   structure of nickel commodities and identifies the drivers of global
   nickel supply chain patterns. The study finds that an increase in
   economic risk promotes diversification of supply sources, while
   political risk hurts export scale and resource control ability.
   Industrial structure adjustments and R\&D investments have a significant
   impact on trade structure, especially on the stainless-steel trade.
   China is a major consumer and importer, and occupies a central position
   in the global nickel trade network, while Indonesia and the Philippines'
   policy changes have a significant impact on the market. This study
   provides an empirical basis for the risk management of the global nickel
   supply chain and a scientific basis for policy formulation and strategic
   planning.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the impact of political stability on Vietnamese
   corporate investment over the period 2010 to 2020. The findings indicate
   a positive relationship between political stability and corporate
   investment. This association persists when employing alternative
   measures of corporate investment and political stability and after
   addressing endogeneity concerns. Notably, this work identifies a
   considerable positive effect of political stability on corporate
   investment following Vietnam's extensive anti-corruption campaign.
   Further analysis reveals that this positive impact is particularly
   significant for firms experiencing higher financial constraints and
   those with considerable institutional and foreign ownership. Most
   interestingly, the effect of political stability on corporate investment
   is consistent across both state-owned and non-state-owned firms. Our
   paper contributes to the corporate finance literature by pioneering an
   investigation into how political stability influences corporate
   investment in a developing Southeast Asian economy. Furthermore, it
   provides an empirical foundation for understanding speculative motives
   and real-option theory within the finance domain. The paper's findings
   have practical implications for business executives and policymakers in
   developing nations facing serious political instability driven by
   corruption issues.JEL Classification: E60, G30, G11.},

Abstract = {Emerging economies are consistently targeting advanced approaches to
   attain sustainable development while reducing their risk exposure and
   factors simultaneously. This research examines the influence of
   political risk, digitization and environmental policies, along with a
   set of economic and environmental factors, on the sustainable
   development of the BRICS economies. For the period from 1990 to 2020,
   the diagnostic tests confirmed a mixed order of integration. Therefore,
   the autoregressive distributed lag test is utilized and the results show
   that political risk, mineral resources and exports are harmful to
   sustainable development in the short run but significantly enhance
   sustainable development in the long run. On the other hand,
   environmental technologies are positively associated with sustainable
   development in the short run but transform into negative development in
   the long run. These diverse influences occur in the short and long run.
   The results indicate a consistent influence of digitization (positive)
   in both the short and long run. The long-run results are authenticated
   using panel fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS). Furthermore,
   the panel causality test validates diverse inferences regarding the
   causal association between the variables. Following the empirical
   outcomes, we recommend policies regarding equitable implementation of
   digital technologies, enhanced investment in environmental and green
   technologies, equitable resource management and a reduction in political
   risk, which could stimulate sustainable development.},

Abstract = {The main objective of this study is to analyse the impact of
   environmental poverty (EP), environmental regulation (ENVR), financial
   constraints (FNC) and political instability (PIST) on carbon dioxide
   emissions (abbr. CO(2)e), with other variables including international
   collaboration in green technology development (ICGTD), hybrid electric
   vehicle technology (HEVT) and gross domestic product per capita (GDPPC).
   The augmented mean group estimator approach is chosen to gauge the
   long-term coefficients. The findings indicate that strengthening ENVR in
   Asian countries can reduce CO(2)e effectively, highlighting the
   importance of policy-driven ecological interventions. In contrast, EP,
   PIST and FNC might worsen CO(2)e, emphasizing the significance of
   political and economic stability for the region's environmental
   sustainability. The results also show that an increased ICGTD and HEVT
   contribute directly to the reduction of CO(2)e in Asian countries. Even
   though economic growth is a sign of development, rising GDPPC in these
   economies is linked to higher CO(2)e, demonstrating that the current
   association between economic growth and achieving carbon neutrality
   could be better.},

Abstract = {This study analyses the impact of political stability and other
   customary covariates, namely, bank-specific, industry-specific, and
   macroeconomic determinants on the profitability of banking sector in
   Ethiopia using two-step system GMM estimator. The study employed a panel
   data of 17 commercial banks for the period of 2012 to 2022, consisting
   of 187 bank-year observations. The regression outcomes reveal that
   political stability has a negative and statistically significant impact
   on the profitability of banks in the case of Ethiopia. This means that
   bank's profitability declines as the country's political instability
   rises. Moreover, the regression results reveal that the profitability of
   banks in Ethiopia is shaped by other customary variables, which are
   bank-specific, industry-specific, and macroeconomic variables. The
   findings are stout and dependable as another model specification is
   undertaken. To the researcher's knowledge, the present study is the
   first to analyse the effect of political stability on the profitability
   of banks in Ethiopia. As a result, it provides better insights for the
   policymakers, regulators, bank managers, analysts, and other interested
   parties to improve the profitability of Ethiopian banks.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TOURISM RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {36},
Abstract = {This study assesses the importance of military expenditure in moderating
   the role of insecurity dynamics on tourist arrivals or international
   tourism in 163 countries. It is framed to assess how the future of
   international tourism can be improved when military expenditure is used
   as a tool to mitigate perceived and real security risks that potentially
   reduce international tourists' arrivals. The empirical evidence is based
   on Negative binomial regressions. The following main findings are
   established. Military expenditure significantly moderates violent crimes
   and perception of criminality to induce a favorable net impact on
   international tourist arrivals. The corresponding net effect is
   insignificant and negative for insecurity dynamics of ``access to
   weapons{''} and ``political instability{''}, respectively. An extended
   analysis is performed to assess thresholds at which political
   instability can be moderated for the desired net effect. This threshold
   is the critical mass at which the unconditional negative impact from
   political instability is neutralized with military expenditure. Policy
   implications are discussed.},

Title = {When Politics Meets Finance: The Moderating Role of Political
   Uncertainty on Investment-Cash Flow Sensitivity},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT 28},
Abstract = {This study investigates how political uncertainty influences the
   relationship between internal cash flow and corporate investment
   decisions among US firms. Using a dataset of 5817 firm-year observations
   from 1079 publicly listed companies between 2013 and 2021, we analyze
   the moderating effect of both firm-level political risk (PRISK) and
   country-level economic policy uncertainty (EPU) on investment-cash flow
   sensitivity (ICFS). The empirical evidence indicates a positive and
   statistically significant relationship between cash flow and corporate
   investment. However, when interacted with political uncertainty metrics,
   both at the macroeconomic level (EPU) and firm-specific level (PRISK),
   this relationship experiences a significant reduction in magnitude. This
   attenuation of ICFS persists regardless of whether political uncertainty
   is measured as a systematic or idiosyncratic risk factor. This negative
   moderating effect remains robust across various specifications,
   including controls for financial constraints, different PRISK
   components, and alternative estimation methods (GMM and 2SLS) using R\&D
   expenditures as an instrumental variable. These results highlight the
   complex interplay between political uncertainty and firm investment
   behavior, particularly for financially constrained firms. The findings
   have important practical implications for corporate managers, investors,
   and policymakers, who must consider political uncertainty as a critical
   factor influencing investment strategies and capital allocation. This
   research contributes to the literature by integrating multiple
   dimensions of political uncertainty into the analysis of ICFS, offering
   new perspectives on how external risk factors alter internal financial
   decision-making dynamics.},

Title = {Market shocks, climate vulnerability, and income loss in informal
   indigenous food systems: evidence from street vendors in Durban, South
   Africa},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NUTRITION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {12},
Month = {SEP 3},
Abstract = {Indigenous food crops are vital for nutrition security, climate
   resilience, and inclusive livelihoods, aligning with Sustainable
   Development Goals 2 (Zero Hunger), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth),
   and 13 (Climate Action). Yet, the street vendors who distribute these
   crops remain highly vulnerable to overlapping socio-environmental
   disruptions. This study investigates how compound shocks (the 2022
   Durban floods, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the 2021 civil unrest) affect
   the economic sustainability of indigenous food crop vendors in South
   Africa. A cross-sectional survey of 34 vendors at Durban's Warwick Early
   Morning Market was conducted, with data analyzed using descriptive
   statistics, and robust regression modeling. Results show that 88\% of
   vendors experienced income loss due to flooding, 71\% due to COVID-19,
   and 68\% due to unrest. The regression model identified lack of cold
   storage (beta = 1.53, p < 0.01), crop perishability (beta = 1.10, p <
   0.05), and exposure to these shocks as statistically significant
   predictors of income reduction. These findings highlight the urgent need
   for inclusive urban food governance, investment in post-harvest
   infrastructure, and support for informal vendors as key actors in
   achieving SDG-aligned, climate-resilient food systems.},

Title = {Self-Interest over Ethics: Firm Withdrawal from Russia After the Ukraine
   Invasion},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},

Volume = {199},
Number = {2},
Pages = {365-391},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Drawing on contrasting theoretical perspectives of self-interest and
   utilitarian/ethical motivations, we examine the degree to which a
   company's pace of departure from Russia after the Ukraine invasion is
   driven by its exposure to the Russian market. Moreover, we investigate
   whether firm-level political and non-political risks influence the
   propensity to delay or expedite the exit/withdrawal process. Contrary to
   utilitarian expectations advocating for ethical exit decisions
   irrespective of exposure and risks, firms with higher Russian exposure
   were less likely to exit sooner, indicating a prioritization of business
   interests over ethical imperatives. This self-interest effect was
   further amplified by heightened political risks but attenuated by
   non-political risks. These findings remained consistent across various
   model specifications, with limited discernible variations based on firm
   characteristics such as ranking, COVID-19 exposure and risk, past
   idiosyncratic volatility, or family ownership and control. In addition,
   an examination of post-exit effects on profitability, risk, cost of
   capital, and liquidity revealed no statistically significant
   relationships. Our study highlights the prevalence of self-interest
   motivations over utilitarian principles, as firms with substantial
   Russian exposure prioritized safeguarding their business interests in
   the aftermath of the Ukraine invasion, even at the potential cost of
   ethical and social responsibility imperatives.},

Title = {The impact demographic factors on economic growth in Somalia},
Journal = {COGENT ECONOMICS \& FINANCE},

Abstract = {Demographic factors significantly influence economic growth by shaping
   labor markets, productivity, and overall economic performance. This
   study investigates the short- and long-term effects of demographic
   variables on Somalia's economic growth using the ARDL model and a
   38-year time-series dataset (1985-2023). The findings reveal that life
   expectancy positively impacts economic growth in both the short and long
   run, highlighting the role of improved health and longevity in enhancing
   productivity. The dependency ratio has a positive long-term effect on
   economic growth, suggesting that Somalia's socio-economic structure,
   characterized by extended family networks and informal economic
   activities, mitigates the economic burden of dependents. In the short
   run, however, the dependency ratio has a negative but statistically
   insignificant effect on GDP per capita. Population growth has a
   significant negative impact on economic growth in both the short and
   long run, indicating that rapid population expansion strains resources
   and hinders development. Additionally, internal conflict adversely
   affects economic growth, underscoring the consequences of political
   instability. The study recommends investing in healthcare, promoting
   education and job creation, enhancing governance, and fostering
   entrepreneurship to improve labor market participation and drive
   long-term economic growth. Strengthening political stability is crucial
   for sustainable development.},

Abstract = {To the extent of our knowledge, there is a gap in scrutinizing the
   impacts of the country's risk and global uncertainty on Asian firms'
   cash holdings. Therefore, this work aims to shed light on this gap by
   choosing 989 listed non-financial Asian firms and performing both the
   static (fixed-effects) and dynamic (Difference-GMM and System-GMM) panel
   data methods between 2008 and 2020. The findings reveal that an increase
   in a country's risk and global uncertainty stimulates firms to stockpile
   more cash though the impact of country risk is more pronounced.
   Likewise, the results underscore that among the country risk factors,
   firms have more precautionary motives to stockpile more cash with
   increases in financial and political instability while they hold more
   cash with rises in economic stability. Remarkably, the results emphasize
   that the impacts of country risk and global uncertainty on cash holdings
   are more prominent in environments characterized by common-law legal
   origin, high uncertainty avoidance cultures, and less financial market
   development. Moreover, the results reveal that firm-specific factors
   including growth opportunity, leverage, profitability, dividend, and
   size have an important role in shaping Asian firms' cash holdings
   policy.},

Abstract = {This study examines the impact of firm-level political risk on
   eco-innovation at the firm level, particularly emphasizing the
   moderating role of CEO power in this relationship. Using a dataset from
   33 countries from 2006 to 2022, we employ two-step dynamic panel data
   estimations to address endogeneity concerns. The findings highlight a
   positive impact of political risk on eco-innovation, which is further
   strengthened in the presence of a powerful CEO. This evidence implies
   that effective leadership from CEOs can assist firms in navigating
   political risks and advancing sustainable initiatives. The results
   remain robust across various specifications, including alternative
   measurements for firm-level political risk. The study highlights the
   crucial role of CEOs in managing political risks and facilitating
   eco-innovative practices within firms.},

Journal = {BUSINESS STRATEGY AND DEVELOPMENT},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Geopolitical risk (GPR) presents a profound challenge to firms,
   particularly in regions with persistent political instability. In
   Eastern Europe, where conflicts like the Russia-Ukraine war heighten
   uncertainty, firms face immediate financial threats and long-term
   strategic vulnerabilities. This study examines the impact of GPR on firm
   performance, focusing on the moderating role of environmental, social,
   and governance (ESG) practices as a resilience mechanism. Using a
   comprehensive dataset of 1360 publicly listed firms across Poland,
   Russia, and Ukraine from 2014 to 2023, the analysis employs a base panel
   data regression model, followed by a two-step generalized method of
   moments (GMM) approach to account for endogeneity and ensure robustness.
   The findings reveal a significant negative relationship between GPR and
   firm performance, measured by return on assets (ROA). Firms exposed to
   higher geopolitical risks exhibit weaker profitability. However, firms
   with stronger ESG performance demonstrate greater resilience, as the GMM
   results show that ESG engagement moderates the adverse effects of GPR on
   profitability. This suggests that ESG initiatives enhance adaptive
   capacity in volatile geopolitical environments. In terms of policy
   implications, ESG should be promoted as a key strategy for firms
   operating in politically unstable regions. Governments and regulatory
   bodies may consider mandatory ESG disclosures and incentivizing
   sustainability practices to help firms mitigate external risks, improve
   financial resilience, and attract stable investment. Aligning corporate
   strategies with global ESG standards is essential to ensuring business
   sustainability amid ongoing geopolitical threats.},

Title = {Investigating the mediating role of political stability in the
   relationship between poverty and growth},
Journal = {REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 SEP 9},
Abstract = {PurposeThis study aims to examine the mediating role of political
   stability in the relationship between economic growth and poverty
   reduction in the MENA region. While several countries in the region have
   experienced economic expansion, persistent poverty remains a challenge,
   often attributed to political instability and weak governance
   structures. The paper also investigates whether long-term political
   dominance, despite ensuring stability, may inadvertently hinder
   inclusive development.Design/methodology/approachUsing annual panel data
   from 13 low- and middle-income Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
   countries over the period 1996-2022, the study employs the system
   generalized method of moments (GMM) to estimate the dynamic effects of
   political stability and absence of violence on the poverty headcount
   ratio. The analysis also includes a squared term to test for potential
   non-linear effects.FindingsThe empirical results suggest that political
   stability significantly contributes to poverty reduction across the
   sample. However, the positive and significant coefficient on the squared
   term indicates a non-linear relationship - suggesting that prolonged
   political dominance by a single party or coalition may dampen
   competition, institutional responsiveness and inclusive policymaking,
   thereby limiting poverty alleviation efforts.Research
   limitations/implicationsWhile this study provides robust evidence on the
   mediating role of political stability in the poverty-growth nexus in the
   MENA region, several limitations should be acknowledged. Data
   constraints, reliance on macro-level indicators and the use of aggregate
   governance measures may limit the granularity and causal depth of the
   findings. Additionally, the analysis does not account for subnational
   variations, regime types or the impact of external shocks such as
   climate and geopolitical instability. Future research could address
   these gaps by employing micro-level data, exploring institutional
   heterogeneity and adopting advanced causal inference
   methods.Originality/valueWhile existing literature often highlights the
   roles of financial development and economic growth in poverty reduction,
   this study provides novel insights into how political stability -
   particularly in fragile or transitioning states - acts as a critical
   governance factor. The findings underscore the importance of balanced
   and accountable political systems in enhancing the poverty-reducing
   impact of growth within the MENA region.},

Title = {Racing toward attaining sustainable development in India: Probing the
   asymmetric effect of country risk and coal energy},
Journal = {NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 25},
Abstract = {The pursuit of a sustainable environment is a common goal for many
   nations; however, achieving this has become increasingly difficult due
   to country-specific risks, often referred to as country risk. Despite
   its importance, the relationship between country risk and environmental
   outcomes is still in its early stages of exploration. This study aims to
   bridge this gap by examining the influence of country risk on India's
   ecological footprint within an asymmetric empirical framework, while
   accounting for economic growth and coal energy consumption. Utilizing
   the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) estimator, the
   analysis covers data from 1984 to 2018. The findings reveal that
   positive changes in economic and financial risk contribute to
   environmental improvement by significantly reducing the ecological
   footprint, whereas negative changes in these risks lead to an increase
   in ecological footprint. Additionally, positive changes in political
   risk, economic growth, and coal energy usage exacerbate the ecological
   footprint, while reductions in coal energy use and political risk lead
   to environmental benefits. Based on these outcomes, policymakers are
   encouraged to establish a clear risk benchmark and reduce the ecological
   footprint by fostering economic growth in a sustainable manner.
   Governments should also prioritize strong support for green technology
   investments and ensure stability across political, economic, and
   financial sectors to promote long-term environmental sustainability.},

Abstract = {Exploring how Islamic banks contribute to poverty reduction, an area
   previously given little attention, extends the examination of the direct
   influence that credit and savings have on poverty alleviation. We argue
   that financial technology (fintech) can be a vital moderating factor in
   the relationship between Islamic banks' total assets and poverty
   alleviation efforts. We employed three scenarios of regression analysis,
   namely, direct, moderation, and marginal effects, in examining balanced
   panel data from Islamic banks operating in developing countries from
   2014 to 2020. Our analysis accounted for various factors such as
   economic growth, political instability, and legal origin. Our findings
   reveal a significantly negative correlation between total assets held by
   Islamic banks and the poverty rate within each country. We observed that
   using fintech, particularly the technology adoption index among the
   population, moderated this relationship. Conversely, although a robust
   and stable economy positively affected poverty reduction, legal origin
   did not directly influence this outcome. These results underscore the
   importance of integrating advancements in fintech into poverty
   alleviation strategies, particularly for policymakers in developing
   countries. Our study contributes original insights by comprehensively
   examining pertinent variables within the context of empirical research.
   We anticipate that our findings will resonate with scholars and
   policymakers in finance, economics, and development studies, offering
   valuable guidance for initiatives that foster development, including
   those outlined in Saudi Arabia's Hail development plans.},

Title = {Dynamic and spillover effects of armed conflicts on renewable energy in
   Subsaharan Africa},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {392},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper investigates the impact of armed conflicts on renewable
   energy consumption in 46 Sub-Saharan African countries over the period
   2000-2020. Understanding this relationship is crucial, as the transition
   to renewable energy is essential for sustainable development, yet it may
   be undermined by political instability and violent conflict. The study
   employs a dynamic spatial econometric approach to capture both spatial
   and temporal effects of armed conflicts on renewable energy use. Using
   the dynamic spatial Durbin model, the findings reveal that armed
   conflicts exert a significant negative influence on renewable energy
   consumption. The estimated impact is 18.76 \% in the dynamic model,
   compared to 17.58 \% in the non-dynamic model. Spatial spillover effects
   suggest that armed conflicts, through contagion and diffusion
   mechanisms, negatively affect renewable energy consumption in
   neighboring countries by approximately 14 \%. Both short and long term
   effects are generally negative and statistically significant.
   Heterogeneity analysis indicates that terrorism has a more pronounced
   effect than other types of conflict. Additionally, the impact of armed
   conflicts is stronger in the Sahel region than in the rest of the
   sample. The paper identifies three main transmission channels through
   which conflict impedes renewable energy consumption: hindered economic
   development, increased military spending at the expense of green
   investment, and heightened uncertainty, which discourages investment and
   disrupts renewable energy production.},

Abstract = {This paper empirically examines how foreign technologies impact firms'

   uses the strategy tripod view theory to develop a novel theoretical

   markets, shows that (i) low levels of perceived political instability
   and increased foreign technologies marginally increase the chances of
   introducing new products or services. (ii) Low levels of informal
   competition and high levels of foreign technologies marginally increase
   product innovation. (iii) High levels of perceived political instability
   and informal competition marginally reduce the likelihood of product
   innovation. (iv) The interaction between perceived political
   instability, informal competition, and foreign technologies marginally
   increases firms' product innovation. Other results reveal the
   significance of firm characteristics, activities, and managerial
   experiences. Some implications for practice, policy, and theory are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {This study advances a resource-based theory and institutional based view
   integrative theoretical model which contends that the export performance
   of firms will depend upon both firm-specific factors and their home
   institutional environments. Specifically, the study hypothesizes that
   firm capital structure (CS), competition from informal sector (IC), and
   political instability (PI) in home countries will directly and
   negatively affect their export performance (EXP). Furthermore, we
   hypothesizes that availability of cash (CA) will have direct and
   positive effect on EXP. Using partial least square structural equation
   model (PLS-SEM), the researchers test the hypotheses based on a dataset
   of 161 firms from Ethiopian manufacturing sector (i.e., Leather
   industry, textile industry, and Food \& Beverage industry). The study
   confirms that CS, IC in home countries, and PI in home countries have
   significant negative effects on the EXP of the firms'. On the other
   hand, there is no statistically significant direct relation exists
   between CA and firm's EXP as measured by sales volume and sales revenue.
   Nonetheless, aside from the insignificant relation between CA and EXP,
   we can conclude that CS has negative impact on firm's EXP.},

Abstract = {This study examines how companies modify their environmental, social,
   and governance (ESG) practices in reaction to geopolitical and political
   risks, presenting a unique empirical methodology that simultaneously
   addresses internal (political) and external (geopolitical) macroeconomic
   vulnerabilities. We use a comprehensive firm-level sample of 37
   countries from 2002 to 2022 (42,587 firm years). Utilizing risk
   management and financial resilience theory, we define ESG as a dynamic,
   responsive mechanism by which corporations alleviate undiversifiable
   shocks. Utilizing a lead-lag autoregressive methodology on a
   cross-country firm-level panel, we demonstrate that ESG participation
   escalates in reaction to increasing risk levels; however, it exhibits
   systematic variation based on firm ESG maturity, industry attributes,
   and risk categories. Companies with inferior ESG scores have a more
   pronounced reaction to political instability, whereas those with
   superior ESG performance respond more acutely to geopolitical upheavals.
   Significantly, we reveal varied reactions across ESG pillars:
   environmental performance typically declines under geopolitical stress,
   whereas social and governance aspects frequently remain stable or
   enhance, indicating short-term adaptive tactics. Sectoral elements, like
   energy intensity and competitive pressure, further influence ESG
   reactions. Our findings provide fresh insights into the environmental
   management consequences of systemic risk exposure, emphasizing the
   necessity for supportive legislative frameworks and risk-sensitive ESG
   structures. This study enhances the existing literature on business
   sustainability by highlighting the strategic importance of ESG in
   improving environmental resilience during unstable geopolitical
   conditions.},

Abstract = {Effective risk management is essential for success in the dynamic
   development of the hotel and restaurant business. Amid increasing
   competition and market instability, there is a need to develop
   innovative risk management strategies. The purpose of the study is to
   develop and test methods for assessing and minimising risks aimed at
   strengthening and sustainable development of enterprises in the hotel
   and restaurant business. Using abstract-logical analysis and a
   systematic approach, the study classifies enterprises depending on the
   level of risk. The results of this study demonstrate a comprehensive
   understanding of innovative management methods in the hotel and
   restaurant industry. The findings indicate that enterprises from the
   initial cluster are less vulnerable to risks, confirming the
   effectiveness of cluster analysis in assessing risks in the hotel and
   restaurant sector. In conditions of economic and political instability,
   systematic analysis and risk management became important. Internal risk
   management strategies, including innovative methods, were successfully
   used to reduce potential threats to the hotel and restaurant business,
   considering the specifics of this industry. The development and support
   of a dynamic information system became a key element, facilitating
   effective risk management and enhancing the competitiveness of
   enterprises. The mentioned enterprises, remaining within the lowest
   level of risk, confirmed the importance of using cluster analysis for
   identifying and managing risks in the hotel and restaurant sector. This
   study introduces innovative approaches to risk management in the hotel
   and restaurant sphere, providing specific strategies that can be used by
   companies to increase resilience and adapt to market competition
   challenges},

Abstract = {The global construction industry has encountered record growth,
   especially following the COVID-19 pandemic period, during which the
   construction industry almost entirely ceased. However, the prices of
   building materials used by the construction sector have increased
   rapidly since the COVID-19 pandemic due to interruptions in the supply
   chain, causing increases in interest rates, inflation rates, and wage
   rates, as well as changes in tax rates. This has resulted in a
   contraction of construction activities in the euro area that warrants
   investigation. The purpose of this study was to empirically evaluate the
   impacts of political, economic, and financial risks on the cost of
   construction materials, which have caused a recession in the European
   economy. In this study, an empirical examination of the long-term
   equilibrium relationship between the construction cost index and various
   risk indices associated with politics, economics, and finance across
   Europe was conducted. This study also explored the construction-led
   growth hypothesis in the eurozone. Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares
   (FMOLSs) and Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLSs) panel estimation
   techniques were employed here. The panel regression results were
   obtained using the FMOLS technique and provided statistically
   significant elasticity coefficients. The results revealed that the
   economic risk index was statistically significant at 1\% with an
   elasticity coefficient of 0.242, whereas both the political risk index
   and the financial risk index had elasticity coefficients of 0.231 and
   0.228 at the 10\% significance level, respectively. The results of this
   study are robust and provide strong empirical evidence that these risk
   factors have negative impacts on the construction cost index within the
   EU area, which is in agreement with the related literature. The results
   of the DOLS estimation methodology were significant only at the 10\%
   significance interval for financial and economic risk parameters, with
   elasticity values of 0.244 and 0.183, respectively. Moreover, the
   results of the Dumitrescu-Hurlin Panel Causality Test determined a
   significant bidirectional causal relationship between the construction
   cost index and the financial, economic, and political risk indices in
   Europe. This study ultimately validates the construction-led growth
   hypothesis for European nations.},

   political risk (EPR) in earnings conference calls (ECCs) has a
   favourable effect on firms' information environment affecting stock
   price crash risk. Under the risk mitigation hypothesis, EPR discourse
   lowers crash risk, whereas, under the risk escalation hypothesis,
   management may exploit information asymmetry leading to greater crash
   risk. Results from US firm-year observations reveal that the EPR
   discourse of the current year reduces the crash risk of the following
   year, thus supporting the risk mitigation hypothesis. Further, this
   study shows that the effect of EPR discourse on crash risk is more
   pronounced for politically active firms, potentially due to their
   proximity to the political decision-making process and better access to
   associated information. Additionally, the results suggest that the
   negative association between EPR discourse and crash risk is stronger in
   the democrat regimes and for the firms with more institutional
   monitoring and characterised by a higher level of integrity. Random
   Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting machine learning algorithms support
   the effectiveness of EPR discourse in predicting crash risk. The primary
   results remain robust to potential endogeneity concerns.},

Title = {Exploring the dynamics of inflation, unemployment, and economic growth
   in Somalia: a VECM analysis},

Abstract = {Maintaining optimal levels of unemployment and external debt remains a
   significant challenge for ensuring consistent economic growth in many
   developing countries. Despite persistent economic difficulties marked by
   political instability, high unemployment, external debt, inflation, and
   limited capital formation, Somalia is increasingly recognizing the
   importance of fostering stability, instituting economic reforms, seeking
   debt relief through international collaborations, and promoting
   inclusive growth. Therefore, this paper empirically examines the
   relationship between gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment,
   external debt, inflation, and gross capital formation in Somalia using
   annual data from 1991 to 2021. To attain the aim of the study, we
   implemented the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF), vector error correction
   model (VECM), variance decomposition, impulse response function, and
   Granger causality test. The outcomes of the study present a negative
   relationship between unemployment and economic growth, implying the
   applicability of Okun's law in Somalia. This suggests that the
   unemployment crisis in Somalia can be attributed to a lack of economic
   growth. Furthermore, the study identified that economic growth is
   negatively associated with inflation and external debt. Moreover, the
   study reveals unidirectional links between unemployment and GDP, gross
   capital formation and GDP, GDP and external debt, CPI and GDP,
   unemployment and gross capital formation, and external debt and
   unemployment. No causal effects were found in the other combinations of
   interactions. To sustain economic growth and job creation, the
   government must implement effective fiscal policies, create an inviting
   atmosphere, and have a flexible labour market policy to encourage the
   private sector and small businesses.
   This study, titled ``Exploring the Dynamics of Inflation, Unemployment,
   and Economic Growth in Somalia: A VECM Analysis,{''} scrutinizes the
   intricate interconnections among essential macroeconomic variables in
   Somalia, utilizing data spanning from 1991 to 2021. Through the
   application of sophisticated econometric methodologies, the research
   substantiates Okun's law, revealing a negative correlation between
   unemployment and economic growth. Additionally, it elucidates the
   detrimental impacts of inflation and external debt on economic
   expansion. The insights garnered from this analysis are invaluable for
   policymakers, underscoring the imperative for effective fiscal policies
   and comprehensive economic reforms to stimulate private sector
   development and the growth of small enterprises. By addressing the
   critical issues of high unemployment, significant external debt, and
   persistent inflation, this study offers pivotal guidance for advancing
   sustainable economic development and ensuring stability in Somalia.},

Title = {Media narratives on (Ecological) sustainability : A topic modeling
   analysis of entrepreneurship news in the MENA region},

Abstract = {Amidst the increasing ecological pressures arising from industrial
   activity and consumerism, with particularly tangible impacts outside of
   the global north, the private sector is being held accountable to reduce
   its environmental footprint and transition to sustainable business
   models and processes. Nevertheless, perceptions of sustainability and
   its dimensions largely vary between cultures and contexts, while local
   media discourses both shape and reflect those concepts and narratives.
   This in turn shapes sustainability practices and the nature and impacts
   of emerging entrepreneurial business activity. Given the dearth of
   sustainability research in the Middle East \& North Africa (MENA) and
   the region's extreme vulnerability to climate change, pollution,
   draughts combined with political instability and institutional
   fragility, this paper provides an in-depth analysis of media narratives
   at the intersection of sustainability and entrepreneurship in the
   region. This was done by means of the machine learning method of topic
   modelling on two datasets of 486 and 217 news media articles extracted
   from a major regional English-language news outlet, followed by a manual
   content analysis of the extracted topics and articles. We find that the
   term sustainability is highly associated with economic prosperity and
   that ecology-related themes are often formulated in terms of financial
   gain, for instance transitioning out of oil \& gas dependence. We find a
   surprising lack of focus on water scarcity and biodiversity, coupled
   with a welcomed focus on the energy transition, recycling, urban
   mobility, as well as social networking and minority integration. Our
   findings hence provide a nuanced contextual understanding of
   sustainability, which may support businesses and decision-makers alike
   in (re)defining priorities and reflecting upon the status quo and
   necessary next steps in the transition to more sustainable societies.},

Title = {The relationship between perceived institutional conditions and

   ownerships},

Abstract = {Country-level institutional conditions are known to play key roles in
   firms' innovation and operations. While it is acknowledged that an
   unfavourable institutional context negatively influences innovation,
   less is known about which firms are most affected by these institutional
   conditions. This research aims to examine which institutional conditions
   affect firms' product innovation and which firms can innovate their
   products despite the unfavourable institutional environment. The
   empirical results based on 21,056 firms from 42 African countries show
   that legal institutions and informal competition positively influence
   product innovation while perceived policy instability has a negative
   influence. The results proved that the interactions between perceived
   policy instability and favourable legal institutions negatively
   influence product innovation. However, the joint effects of these
   institutional conditions positively impact product innovation. Private
   domestic ownership positively moderates the relationship between a
   favourable legal environment and product innovations, while foreign
   ownership negatively moderates the relationship between a favourable
   legal environment and product innovations. Finally, the results showed
   that both domestic and foreign ownerships negatively moderate the
   relationship between perceived policy instability and product
   innovation. The main practical implication from our result is that
   policy practitioners in African countries should endeavour to reduce the
   potential negative impact of the policy instability and unfavourable
   legal environment for foreign-owned firms as it reduces their incentives
   to innovate.},

Abstract = {This article delves into the complex dynamics of Vietnam's
   democratization process, highlighting the simultaneous influences of
   international integration and advancements in science and technology.
   This study investigates the impact of Vietnam's increasing involvement
   in the global economy and international community, as well as its
   adoption of technological advancements, on the country's path toward
   democratization. The study utilizes a mixed approach, blending
   qualitative analysis of scientific documents, Vietnamese government
   policies, and quantitative data on the democracy index from
   international organizations. It identifies international integration as
   a doubleedged sword: on one hand, it boosts economic growth and
   development, driving the democratic transition process forward; on the
   other hand, it also leads to economic dependence and inequality,
   potentially impeding democratic reform. The findings of this study show
   that the rapid progress of science and technology, especially
   information and communication technology, presents both opportunities
   and difficulties for Vietnam's democratic process. It provides
   unparalleled opportunities for widespread involvement in political
   activities and the spread of democratic principles, but it also carries
   the risk of social unrest and the potential for the authoritarian state
   to control and manipulate information.},

   geopolitical risk},

Abstract = {Corporations face multifaceted environmental uncertainties (EU) in
   today's dynamic global economic environment. Such uncertainties
   profoundly affect corporate operations and pose significant challenges
   to their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance.
   Therefore, using data from Chinese A-share listed corporations from 2009
   to 2021, we empirically analyze the impact of the EU on ESG performance.
   The results demonstrate that the EU significantly negatively impacts ESG
   performance, indicating that corporations frequently find it difficult
   to implement and maintain high-standard ESG policies and practices
   effectively. Additionally, they reveal that the EU inhibits the
   improvement of ESG performance by increasing corporate financing
   constraints (KZ). Lastly, this study explores the role of government
   subsidies (GOV), investor attention (IA), and geopolitical risks (GPR)
   as moderating variables. We discover that GOV can mitigate the negative
   impact of the EU on KZ because they provide additional resources that
   help corporations maintain their ESG in uncertain environments.
   Furthermore, IA can reduce the adverse impact of KZ on ESG. Positive
   moderating effects result from ESG issues; the capital they provide
   effectively reduces corporate KZ, thus enabling corporations to maintain
   good ESG performance despite operating in highly uncertain environments.
   However, due to the increased asymmetry of information in economic
   markets caused by geopolitical tensions, GPR exacerbates the negative
   impact of the EU on ESG performance, thus leading to an increase in KZ.
   These findings offer new perspectives on understanding how these
   moderating effects affect corporate ESG strategies.},

Abstract = {Income inequality remains a critical challenge globally, with developing
   nations experiencing the most severe disparities. In fragile states like
   Somalia, climate change and political instability exacerbate economic
   inequality, limiting opportunities and deepening structural inequities.
   This study empirically examines the impact of climate change, political
   stability, and macroeconomic variables-including GDP per capita,
   inflation, population growth, and urbanization-on income inequality in
   Somalia from 1980 to 2022. Using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag
   (ARDL) model and Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS), the
   study explores both short-run and long-run dynamics. The findings reveal
   that in the long run, rising temperatures significantly increase income
   inequality, while GDP per capita growth reduces disparities. Political
   stability, though beneficial for economic growth, is associated with
   widening inequality, suggesting that economic gains during stable
   periods are not evenly distributed. Population growth exacerbates income
   inequality, while inflation and urbanization show no significant
   long-run effects. In the short run, rainfall increases inequality, while
   short-term temperature fluctuations temporarily reduce disparities due
   to seasonal labor demand. The error correction term confirms a stable
   long-run relationship, with approximately 36.8\% of disequilibrium
   corrected annually. FMOLS results reinforce the robustness of these
   findings, emphasizing climate factors and economic growth as key
   determinants of inequality. These findings highlight the need for
   policies that mitigate climate-induced inequality, promote equitable
   wealth distribution, and ensure inclusive economic growth. Strengthening
   climate adaptation, expanding financial inclusion, stabilizing
   inflation, and supporting rural development are essential to fostering
   long-term economic equity in Somalia.},

Abstract = {We investigate whether political risk is priced in the cross-section of
   corporate bond returns by using a text-based measure of firm-level
   political risk. We document a positive and significant political risk
   premium after controlling for bond and firm characteristics,
   conventional risk factors, and exposure to aggregate economic policy
   uncertainty. Bonds with higher political and credit risk, as well as
   smaller, more illiquid, and longer maturity corporate bonds exhibit a
   larger political risk premium. Time-series analysis indicates that
   monetary policy shocks and common shocks in the equity and bond market
   exhibit a statistically significant and positive association with the
   political risk premium. Our findings reveal the importance of
   idiosyncratic political risk beyond common risk factors and aggregate
   economic policy uncertainty.},

Abstract = {In the pursuit of sustainable development, economies such as China are
   placing a paramount emphasis on significantly augmenting the utilization
   of renewable energy sources. This marks a departure from conventional
   research approaches that solely focused on macroeconomic determinants
   while investigating patterns of renewable energy consumption. Thus, this
   research pursues to witness the relationship between the political risk
   index (PRI), renewable electricity output (RELOP), public -private
   partnership investment in energy (PPINENR), and renewable energy
   consumption (RECNS) in China from 1984 to 2022. For data estimations,
   this study utilizes time series methods, which include DF-GLS and
   Johansen cointegration for unit root and long -run equilibrium with
   FMOLS, DOLS and CCR as primary methods. The research also employs the
   least squares method with break years and robust least squares as
   robustness check methods while for causal relationships, we deploy the
   Granger causality approach. The outcomes assert that variables are found
   stationary at differences and long -run equilibrium is confirmed among
   variables. The empirical estimations predict that GDP and PPINENR reduce
   the RECNS in China in both short and long term. Furthermore, PRI and
   RELOP enhance renewable energy consumption in the short as well as long
   run. Therefore, policymakers should mostly focus on the encouraging role
   of PPINENR towards renewable electricity to enhance RECNS in developing
   economies, particularly in China. To achieve the targets of COP27, China
   should increase its focus on the efficient utilization of public
   -private partnership investments and also manage the political risks in
   the economy to promote renewable energy consumption and achieve a
   sustainable environment. Moreover, the causality analysis unearths that
   PRI could be utilized along with other variables to enhance RECNS in
   China. The robustness check asserts similar and robust outcomes.},

Abstract = {Conflict remains a major driver of poverty in Africa. Conflicts and
   political instability in the region have been increasing recently and
   are drawing more attention in public discourse. While it is widely
   acknowledged that conflicts disrupt agricultural production and food
   systems, the full extent of the damage inflicted on the lives and
   livelihoods of farming households and the mechanisms to redress this
   harm remain poorly understood. In particular, the link between violent
   conflicts and households' land allocation and related agricultural
   investment decisions remains understudied. In this study, we use
   geocoded longitudinal data along with detailed agricultural panel
   household surveys in Nigeria to assess the impact of violent conflicts
   on crop choice decisions and related agricultural investments.
   Specifically, we explore how farmers' land allocation and agricultural
   investment decisions relate or respond to the outbreak and intensity of
   violent conflicts. We find that violent conflicts are associated with a
   reduction in the share of both land area cultivated and area harvested.
   We also find suggestive evidence that violent conflicts may shape
   farmers' crop choices and related investments, as violent conflicts are
   associated with reduction in the share of land allocated to long-term
   crops (e.g., perennial crops, trees, roots and tubers). Overall, our
   findings suggest that violent conflicts can negatively influence
   farmers' agricultural investments directly by affecting both land
   utilization patterns and portfolio allocation across activities with
   varying returns to investments.},

Title = {Impacts of corporate governance mechanisms on dynamics of banks
   financial performance: empirical evidences from private commercial banks

Abstract = {This study aims to investigate the effects of corporate governance
   structures on the financial performance of private commercial banks in
   Ethiopia. For this purpose, panel data from 2014 to 2023 with the
   dynamic GMM estimation approach were used. From 2014 to 2023, the
   average board size for banks was 2.303, with an average gender
   composition of 22\%. Moreover, the average bank size in Ethiopia has
   increased by 22.47\% since 2018, while political uncertainty has had a
   two-way impact on private commercial banks in Ethiopia. The empirical
   results reveal that corporate governance (larger board size and gender
   composition), along with growth of bank size, capitalization ratio, and
   reserve ratio, has improved the financial performance of private
   commercial banks in Ethiopia by developing a solid structure for
   enhancing equity returns and integrating comprehensive strategies.
   However, political instability and a higher leverage ratio have
   freighted banks performances'. Therefore, private commercial banks
   enhance a suitable amount of bank size and board size to foster economic
   diversification, innovations, and managerial capability at the lowest
   operating cost; boost their reserve ratio and capitalization ratio to
   address the liquidity problem; and develop an integrated risk management
   strategy and leverage estimation to address uncertainties.},

Title = {The Impact of Dual Uncertainties in Import Country Policies and Market
   Environments on Chinese Electric Vehicle Exports},
Journal = {WORLD ELECTRIC VEHICLE JOURNAL},

Abstract = {The export of electric vehicles (EVs) is crucial for addressing global
   environmental challenges and achieving sustainable development goals.
   However, Chinese EV enterprises encounter significant obstacles when
   entering international markets due to the complex and variable policy
   and market environments of importing countries. This study explores the
   combined effects of import country policies and market environments on
   exports by utilizing panel data from Chinese EV companies' exports to
   multiple countries, employing an OLS panel data regression model. The
   research examines the impact of dual uncertainty in the
   ``policy-market{''} environment of import countries on Chinese EV
   exports. The findings indicate that uncertainty in the policy
   environment of importing countries has a significant negative effect on
   Chinese EV exports, while uncertainty in the market environment does not
   exert a substantial impact. Notably, when policy and market
   uncertainties interact, this dual uncertainty significantly exacerbates
   the negative effects of market environment uncertainty on Chinese EV
   exports. These results highlight the importance for Chinese EV
   enterprises to closely monitor policy changes in importing countries and
   adopt effective strategies to mitigate the impacts of dual uncertainties
   in the ``policy-market{''} environment. Furthermore, it is recommended
   that governments of importing countries consider the implications of
   their policies on international trade, particularly in the context of
   EVs, to promote the healthy development of the global EV market.},

Abstract = {While a firm can minimize its own political risk, there are
   idiosyncratic and country-specific risks that are more difficult to
   control. In particular, home country governments pursue their own
   foreign policies independently of business, forging international
   linkages with other countries in pursuit of tangible benefits. But what
   happens when a government forges connectivity to a country which
   exhibits volatility or generates geopolitical shocks? This paper
   examines this question by studying the response of European stock
   markets to the ongoing (since 2014) Russian invasion of Ukraine. Using a
   variety of metrics to measure political connectivity, we distinguish
   between anti-Russian governments and governments which are more
   favorable to Russia during this period, combining this connectivity data
   with a new database of sanctions and war-related events. Applying
   asymmetric GARCH, panel estimations, and event study methods, we find
   that the uncertainty caused by Russian aggression in Ukraine has harmed
   financial markets in countries such as Serbia and Hungary, countries
   which have willingly forged connections with Russia during this time.
   Consistently, our empirical results show that, by tying a country to
   another one via political means, politicians also have tied the fortunes
   of their capital markets to the success or failure of this partner.},

Title = {Resilience of GVC suppliers in politically unstable regions: The roles
   of governance and trust},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS REVIEW},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {34},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Supplier firms in the Global South face compounded risks from political
   instability that challenge their ability to maintain participation in
   global value chains (GVCs). While resilience is increasingly
   acknowledged as a critical capability, it remains unclear how suppliers
   develop resilience when conventional GVC governance strategies, often
   grounded in institutional stability, prove insufficient. This gap is
   especially pronounced in knowledgeintensive service sectors like
   software development, where codification, coordination, and inter-firm
   trust are central but often disrupted by political instability. This
   study examines the resilience of GVC suppliers operating in politically
   unstable regions of South Asia, particularly India and Pakistan. It
   focuses on the role of governance mechanisms-such as codification,
   managing complexity, and supplier capabilities, on supplier resilience.
   It also investigates how trust moderates these relationships. Drawing on
   Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) and the Dynamic Capabilities View
   (DCV), we argue that these governance mechanisms function not only as
   efficiency enablers but also as dynamic governance adaptations that
   suppliers actively mobilize to survive and adapt. A quantitative
   analysis using partial least squares structural equation modeling
   (PLS-SEM) was conducted on survey data collected from 100 software
   firms. The results show that task codification and management of task
   complexity enhance supplier resilience. It further reveals that trust
   negatively affects the links between task codification and resilience,
   challenging the conventional assumption that trust uniformly strengthens
   GVC relationships. The core theoretical contribution of this study lies
   in extending TCE and DCV by showing how resilience is enabled through
   external governance adaptation and by rethinking trust as a conditional,
   contextdependent mechanism rather than a universal good.},

Title = {Long-term asymmetric impacts of insecurity and corruption on development

Abstract = {This research evaluates the long-term asymmetric impacts of insecurity
   and corruption on the development of tourism in Nigeria using a
   non-linear ARDL (NARDL) method to analyze quarterly data for the
   1996-2021 period. The cointegration test result provides an evidence of
   a long-term relationship among these three variables (corruption,
   insecurity and tourism development), along with exchange rate, income
   and infrastructure. The asymmetry test results reveal asymmetry between
   tourism development and both corruption and insecurity. The outcomes of
   the empirical exercise indicate that a positive shock to control of
   corruption (decline in corruption) fosters long-term tourism
   development, while a negative shock to control of corruption (increase
   in corruption) does not significantly explain long-term tourism
   development. In addition, a positive change in government expenditure on
   internal security (increase in internal insecurity) lowers long-term
   tourism development, but a negative change in government spending on
   internal security (decrease in internal insecurity) enhances long-term
   tourism development. Depreciation of the domestic currency promotes
   long-term tourism development. Thus, policies that reduce corruption and
   insecurity are recommended to promote longterm development of the
   tourism sector in Nigeria.},

Abstract = {The article puts forward a new version of elite theory based on the use
   of a macroeconomic production function depending on the number of the
   elites and the masses. At the same time, the production function of the
   elites is complemented with the distribution function, which determines
   the income structure of social groups and the level of inequality.
   Combining the two sides of the activity of the elites allows us to
   design a simple typology of political situations in the country and
   highlight the regime of revolutionary situation. A formal analysis of
   the model of production activity of the elites has shown that the
   phenomenon of over-accumulation of the ruling class has a noticeable
   destructive impact on economic growth only after a severe drop in its
   functioning effectiveness. The very deterioration of the quality of the
   political elite allows an unjustified increase in its size to manifest
   itself. We consider generalizations of elite model in relation to the
   case of the middle class and show the invariance of the previously
   obtained conclusions. We provide an interpretation of the macro-theory
   of the elites for the mega-level, when studying the world economic
   system as a combination of the center, periphery and semi-periphery. We
   consider four dimensions of the elite, with system paradigms being a new
   element within these dimensions. The influence of external historical
   events on the worldview of the elites and their actions is revealed
   using the examples of the transformation of the Roman Republic into the
   Roman Empire, the collapse of the USSR and the beginning of the fall of
   the U.S. hegemony. For the center - periphery system, we test the
   production model of the elites with the help of statistical data from
   the World Bank; we build econometric dependencies that show a decrease
   in the effectiveness of the United States in managing global production},

Title = {Policy market orientation, property rights, and corruption effects on
   the rent of non-renewable resources in Latin America and the Caribbean},
Journal = {RESOURCES POLICY},

Abstract = {This study aims to evaluate the role of two institutional variables
   (property rights and corruption) and two outward-oriented policies
   (trade and capital account openness) on the rents of non-renewable
   natural resources in Latin America and the Caribbean. The sample under
   study involves data from 20 countries during the period 1971-2019. Thus,
   we attempt to explore the long-run relationship between the
   aforementioned variables. The methodological procedure involved checking
   for cross-sectional dependence and evaluating the order of integration
   of the variables. We have also verified the coefficients' slope
   homogeneity and the absence of structural breaks, as well as confirming
   cointegration. Finally, we have estimated the model using two
   techniques; Park's Feasible Generalized Least Squares and a new
   instrumental variable approach put forward by Norkute et al. (2021) and
   Cui et al. (2022). Better property rights laws, according to our
   research, benefit rents. In contrast, we have demonstrated that
   corruption has a detrimental effect, supporting the ``sand in the wheel
   hypothesis.{''} On the other side, the findings show that opening trade
   and capital accounts has a favorable effect on rents. Our findings thus
   serve as a warning about the need to enhance the quality of institutions
   by lowering political risk, encouraging upstanding legal principles, and
   combating corruption. Last but not least, in agreement with Arezki et
   al. (2019), our results clearly support the notion that an outward
   market orientation has a favorable impact on the endowments of
   nonrenewable natural resources.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the political economy of connectivity in the
   Somali Horn of Africa (HoA). On the one hand, it charts the emergence of
   firms in Somalia and Somaliland at the intersection of telecommunication
   and finance, eventually controlling logistics through digital platforms
   that enable the circulation of people, goods and value across the
   region. On the other, it examines the historical and political elements
   that have shaped a peculiar instance of digital capitalism against a
   backdrop of protracted insecurity and state fragility. It uses the
   specific case-study of digital platforms in the Somali HoA to provide
   insights into the multiple shapes that digital capitalism can take. To
   advance the authors' analysis, the article links the notions of digital
   infrastructural power and `extrastatecraft'. Empirically, it delves into
   the case of digital platforms in the Somali HoA to illustrate how the
   unique digital landscape of the region has evolved over fifty years of
   political instability and economic volatility. Theoretically, the
   article navigates the implications of the state's heavy reliance on
   privately owned and managed platforms amid the backdrop of variegated
   digital capitalism narratives, which have predominantly centred on the
   global North.},

Abstract = {One of the most important trends noted by researchers in the
   revolutionary events of recent decades is the rapid increase in the
   share of unarmed revolutionary uprisings and, accordingly, a decrease in
   the share of armed revolutionary insurgencies. The study of this trend
   is of great importance. This work continues previous research on unarmed
   revolutionary destabilization. Unlike in past studies, the authors here
   have significantly expanded the time range taken into account,
   considered together the main factors in the onset of unarmed (similar to
   ``nonviolent{''}) revolutionary uprisings, and significantly improved
   the methodology by combining these factors within one model. As a
   result, the study found that most variables are related to the
   probability of an onset of unarmed revolutions in a curvilinear manner,
   which explains the weak statistical relationship for some variables in
   the works of predecessors. The following have a non-linear relationship:
   the duration of the regime's existence, economic growth, the level of
   democracy, the degree of corruption within the regime, urbanization, GDP
   per capita, the ``youth bulge{''}, oil production, levels of
   discrimination. In addition, the key determinants of the onset of
   unarmed revolutionary uprisings were identified and ranked in order of
   their importance. The analysis performed allows us to assume that the
   onset of unarmed revolutionary uprisings is most likely in upper middle
   income states with young political regimes, high populations, very low
   (as well as very high) rates of economic growth, intermediate political
   regimes (partial democracy or, especially, partial autocracy), a high
   level of corruption of the regime (despite the fact that an extremely
   high level of corruption still has a rather inhibiting effect on the
   likelihood of an unarmed revolution onset), significant financial
   assistance from the United States, a fairly high level of coverage of
   population with modern formal education, a very long incumbent duration,
   a fairly high proportion of urban residents in the total population, the
   presence of a certain culture of protest, as well as low or no oil
   income. At the same time, it is confirmed that the likelihood of the
   outbreak of unarmed revolutions has increased markedly after the end of
   the Cold War due to changes in the global geopolitical situation.},

Title = {MANAGEMENT OF GEOPOLITICAL RISKS OF ENTERPRISES IN THE TOURISM AND
   HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY IN UKRAINE},
Journal = {BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {150-157},
Abstract = {The article examines the theoretical and practical aspects of managing
   geopolitical risks faced by enterprises in the tourism and hospitality
   industry in Ukraine. The risks have intensified due to ongoing political
   instability, armed conflict, and economic disruptions, posing
   significant challenges to the sustainable development of these sectors.
   The purpose of the present study is to identify effective strategies and
   tools for mitigating the impact of geopolitical risks on the functioning
   and development of enterprises in the tourism and hospitality industry.
   The objectives of the research are threefold: firstly, to explore the
   key geopolitical threats affecting the tourism and hospitality sectors
   in Ukraine; secondly, to analyse the existing management practices for
   addressing such risks; and thirdly, to propose a framework for enhancing
   resilience and ensuring sustainable development in the face of
   geopolitical challenges. The research also evaluates the influence of
   geopolitical risks on customer behaviour, investment attractiveness, and
   international partnerships, which are crucial for the recovery and
   growth of these sectors. The methodological basis of the paper is a
   systematic approach, combining qualitative and quantitative methods,
   including case studies, expert interviews, and statistical analysis, to
   comprehensively assess the nature and consequences of geopolitical risks
   and develop strategies for their management. The study emphasises that
   geopolitical instability, encompassing military conflicts, sanctions,
   and shifts in international relations, exerts a substantial influence on
   the economic performance and operational stability of enterprises. The
   research suggests that enterprises can adapt to changing conditions by
   adopting innovative risk management practices, such as scenario
   planning, diversification of markets, and digitalization of services.
   The proposal of effective approaches includes the integration of
   adaptive strategies, the use of global best practices, and the
   strengthening of international co-operation. Moreover, the study
   emphasises the significance of collaboration between the public and
   private sectors in implementing national-level risk management
   programmes. It is concluded that the development of a comprehensive
   framework for managing geopolitical risks, tailored to the needs of the
   tourism and hospitality industry, is essential to enhance their
   competitiveness and attractiveness in the global market. The overarching
   structure should comprise explicit guidelines for risk assessment,
   crisis management, and recovery planning, thereby ensuring the long-term
   sustainability of the industry. The findings contribute to the
   theoretical and practical understanding of geopolitical risk management
   and provide actionable recommendations for policymakers, business
   leaders, and researchers.},

Abstract = {Creative localities are a poorly studied phenomenon from both
   theoretical and empirical perspectives. The authors, relying on Joas's
   concept of situational creativity, define creative localities as new
   self-organizing forms of social space, which are characterized by a
   certain localization and specific social interaction, which provokes
   creative processes that transform urban life. The article presents the
   results of a study of youth creative localities among Russian megacities
   using the example of two segments business (young startup people
   promoting their innovative ideas/projects; young specialists and heads
   of departments in innovative ``advanced{''} companies) and urban
   creative activism (young organizers and volunteers of city events,
   street art festivals; young authors of creative ``products{''} of city
   festivals and events; members of city communities engaged in
   micro-practices of transforming the urban environment). The empirical
   basis of the research is in-depth interviews with the agents of
   ``making{''} a creative ``product{''}. Based on the analysis of
   interview data, the following conclusions are drawn. The main condition
   for the implementation of creative projects is the social
   micro-environment of direct interaction and support - a team, partners,
   like-minded people, a community. At the meso- and macro-environment
   level, the necessary conditions for urban activists are financial
   support from the state, local administrations, federal and regional
   businesses, grant funds, while maintaining freedom of expression and
   minimizing pressure from the authorities; for business representatives,
   this means information support from the state, financial support from
   private investors, and the presence of a politically neutral educational
   platform for the exchange of experience. Barriers hindering the
   development of creative localities are most significantly manifested at
   the meso- and macro-levels: for urban activists, these are
   misunderstandings, negative attitudes from residents and local media,
   the ongoing supervisory policy of the state, and restrictions on
   grassroots creative initiatives that accompany this policy; for business
   representatives, this is general socio-economic and political
   instability, closed access to global technologies, overall systemic
   corruption.},

   TC Energy and the political economy of investor-state dispute settlement},
Journal = {BUSINESS AND POLITICS},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 APR 14},
Abstract = {The international investment regime provides generous protections for
   foreign investors against adverse legal changes in host states, and
   unusually strong procedural rights to enforce those protections in
   investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS). Scholars have observed that
   the regime enables corporate capital accumulation and raises the costs
   of climate action, potentially deterring states from adopting ambitious
   climate policies. Building on this literature, we locate a key source of
   these concerns in the asymmetric treatment of state and investor
   behavior in ISDS, which allows investors to depict themselves as
   innocent victims of ``unfair{''} and ``unforeseeable{''} ``political{''}
   processes, despite themselves being active political players and
   sophisticated political risk managers-a tactic we call feigned
   victimization. This tactic is employed by fossil fuel companies to
   achieve capital accumulation and climate obstruction goals. We
   illustrate our argument through an empirical case study of TC Energy's
   US\$15 billion ISDS claim against the United States in relation to the
   Biden Administration's revocation of a permit required to construct the
   Keystone XL oil pipeline. Our case study also illustrates a method by
   which states can expose feigned victimization tactics by investors and
   incorporate evidence of this into their legal defenses in ISDS.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to investigate the volatility spillovers among selected
   emerging economies' sovereign credit default swaps (SCDSs), including
   those of Saudi Arabia, Russia, China, Indonesia, South Africa, Brazil,
   Mexico, and Turkey. Using data from January 2010 to July 2023, we apply
   the time-domain and the frequency-domain connectedness
   approaches.Empirical results show that (i) Indonesia, followed by China
   and Mexico, are the main transmitters of sovereign credit risk
   volatility. (ii) Among global factors, the volatility index (VIX),
   economic policy uncertainty (EPU), and global political risk (GPR)
   positively impacted spillover on lower and higher quantiles. The results
   offer critical insights for international investors, policymakers, and
   researchers, emphasizing the importance of risk-aware investment
   strategies and cautious policy formulation in the context of financial
   crises and political events.},

Title = {SOCIO-ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE EFFICIENCY OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE
   TOURIST AND RECREATIONAL POTENTIAL OF THE ZAKARPATTIA OBLAST IN THE
   FIELD OF RURAL GREEN TOURISM},

Abstract = {The article presents the results of a study of the tourism and
   recreational potential of small and micro-enterprises in the sphere of
   rural green tourism in the Zakarpattia Oblast in the context of crisis
   and instability. It analyses the social factors influencing the
   development of this sector of the state economy, identifies problematic
   aspects in their activities that may negatively affect the development
   of tourism in general, as well as the impact of such crisis phenomena as
   COVID-19, its consequences and martial law. The authors have identified
   the factors that have a destructive impact and the factors that would
   contribute to overcoming the crisis. The aim of the research is to
   conduct a socio-economic study of the development of tourist and
   recreational potential of rural green tourism in the region and identify
   ways to unlock the potential of this sphere of the region's economy,
   which will be effective for their practical implementation in the
   activities of accommodation and catering enterprises. Methodology. The
   study was conducted on the basis of a survey of managers and owners of
   rural green tourism enterprises through a personal questionnaire, as
   well as an analysis of statistical indicators of the performance of
   temporary accommodation enterprises, based on official statistics of the
   Zakarpattia Oblast for 2020 and 2021 and provided by the Main Department
   of Statistics in the Zakarpattia Oblast. The monitoring covered private
   peasant farms in the region, namely 90 owners of such tourist
   farmsteads, of whom 70\% were middle-aged (36-55 years old), 58\% of
   them combine employment in the tourism sector with their main job in the
   public sector, and 6\% have their own business other than the service
   sector. The results of the study demonstrate that the activities,
   development and general existence of rural green tourism in the region
   are affected by such destructive processes as crisis phenomena such as
   COVID-19, political instability, martial law and other macro- and
   microeconomic factors, which can be overcome or at least minimised by
   their impact on the tourism services sector to increase the viability of
   small businesses, which, as is known from international practice, is one
   of the elements of overall economic growth in the region and the state
   as a whole. According to the results of the study, the factors
   influencing the activities of enterprises, the behavioural patterns of
   owners of rural green tourism institutions in the context of the crisis
   were identified and mechanisms for minimising and overcoming the
   consequences of the crisis were developed, such as: diversification of
   business and expansion of the types of services that can be provided to
   potential consumers, introduction of an effective management and
   marketing system, adoption of European experience in the field of green
   tourism and proposals for improving the legislative framework for
   businesses to leave the shadow economy.},

Title = {The effect of government expenditure on unemployment in Somalia using
   ARDL model},
Journal = {COGENT ECONOMICS \& FINANCE},

Abstract = {Somalia faces significant challenges in maintaining low unemployment and
   achieving sustainable economic growth, especially due to traditional
   development bottlenecks such as political instability, inadequate
   infrastructure and excessive reliance on foreign aid. Realizing the need
   for inclusiveness of growth, this study empirically investigates the
   relationship between unemployment and the selected macroeconomic
   variables, namely, government expenditure, gross domestic product (GDP),
   agricultural value added and official development assistance (ODA),
   using annual data from 1990 to 2023. The study employs the
   Autoregressive Distributed Lag to estimate both the long run as well as
   short-run dynamics, while the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test is employed
   to ascertain stationarity of the variables, and Granger causality tests
   help us in determining causal direction among variables. The long-term
   findings reveal that increased government expenditure, GDP growth and
   agricultural output play a significant part in reducing unemployment,
   while ODA exerts a minimal influence on raising unemployment with
   implications of possible inefficiencies or aid dependency. Short-term
   unemployment dynamics are influenced by both GDP and agriculture. While
   GDP consistently reduces unemployment across lags, agriculture has mixed
   effects that suggest short-term frictions or transition issues.
   Causality analysis shows that there is a two-way causal relationship
   between GDP, government spending and ODA and a unidirectional
   relationship between unemployment and government spending. These
   findings require concentrated fiscal policy, efficient public spending,
   incremental agricultural modernization and better-linked foreign
   assistance focused on employment creation steps vital to the reduction
   of unemployment and the support of inclusive, sustainable growth in
   Somalia's unsettled economic environment.},

Title = {Exploring factors influencing manufacturing home-shoring strategies:
   insights from three diverse geographical regions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS POLICY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Due to the ongoing political instability and economic disruptions in the
   environments where firms operate, the shift towards regional value
   chains is redefining global supply chains. Driven by economic policies
   in regions such as the EU and North America that aim to enhance autonomy
   and resilience, factors influencing supply chain location decisions have
   become increasingly important for both business leaders and
   policymakers. In this context, our paper integrates international
   business, economic geography, and the global value chain framework to
   investigate the efficiency-seeking, knowledge-seeking, and
   supplier-seeking factors that influence home-shoring strategies within
   manufacturing activities. Our work specifically focuses on identifying
   which of these factors underpin three key manufacturing home-shoring
   strategies. Utilising unique primary sub-national-level data and a
   multinomial logit model, our work examines these strategies across three
   regions: Veneto (Italy), England (UK), and California (US). Our findings
   highlight the importance of efficiency-seeking factors as central pull
   drivers of manufacturing home-shoring strategies. For policymakers, this
   study underscores the need for a nuanced and regionally tailored
   approach, as local supplier dynamics and the availability of supportive
   public policies impact the success of full manufacturing home-shoring
   strategies across different locations.
   The article discusses the shift in manufacturing strategies by
   multinational enterprises (MNEs) due to global changes and technological
   advancements. In the past, many companies moved their production
   overseas to cut costs, a trend known as offshoring. However, recent
   events like the COVID-19 pandemic have exposed the vulnerabilities of
   long supply chains. This has led to a new trend called home-shoring,
   where companies are investing in manufacturing activities in their home
   countries. The study aims to understand what factors drive this decision
   and how different strategies are used.This article explores the reasons
   behind home-shoring by analysing data from companies in Italy, the UK,
   and the US. Researchers used surveys to gather information on why firms
   choose to invest in their home contries. They focused on three main
   factors: efficiency-seeking (improving production processes),
   knowledge-seeking (accessing local expertise), and supplier-seeking
   (working with local suppliers). The study used a statistical method
   called a multinomial logit model to analyse these factors and determine
   which are most important for companies when deciding to home-shore.The
   findings reveal that efficiency-seeking factors are the most significant
   drivers for companies choosing to home-shore. This includes investments
   in automation and digital technologies that make production more
   efficient. While knowledge-seeking and supplier-seeking factors are also
   considered, they are less influential in the decision-making process.
   The study concludes that for successful home-shoring, firms need
   supportive local policies and a strong network of local suppliers. This
   research highlights the importance of adapting manufacturing strategies
   to enhance resilience and efficiency in supply chains. Future
   implications suggest that as technology continues to evolve, more
   companies may adopt home-shoring strategies to stay competitive and
   resilient against global disruptions.This text was initially drafted
   using artificial intelligence, then reviewed by the author(s) to ensure
   accuracy.

   Entscheidungstr \& auml;ger von zunehmender Bedeutung. In diesem
   Zusammenhang integriert unsere Arbeit die internationale
   Betriebswirtschaftslehre, Wirtschaftsgeographie und den Rahmen globaler
   Wertsch \& ouml;pfungsketten, um Faktoren der Effizienzsteigerung, der
   Wissenssteigerung und der Lieferantensuche zu ermitteln, die
   Home-Shoring-Strategien in der verarbeitenden Industrie beeinflussen.
   Unsere Arbeit konzentriert sich insbesondere auf die Identifizierung der
   Faktoren, die drei wichtigen Home-Shoring-Strategien in der
   verarbeitenden Industrie zugrunde liegen. Unter Verwendung von Prim \&
   auml;rdaten auf subnationaler Ebene und eines multinomialen
   Logit-Modells untersuchen wir diese Strategien in drei Regionen:
   Venetien (Italien), England (Gro ss britannien) und Kalifornien (USA).
   Unsere Ergebnisse unterstreichen die Bedeutung von Effizienzfaktoren als
   zentrale Determinanten von Home-Shoring-Strategien in der verarbeitenden
   Industrie. F \& uuml;r politische Entscheidungstr \& auml;ger
   unterstreicht diese Studie die Notwendigkeit eines differenzierten und
   auf die jeweilige Region zugeschnittenen Ansatzes, da die Dynamik der
   lokalen Zulieferer und die Unterst \& uuml;tzung durch politische Ma ss
   nahmen den Erfolg von Home-Shoring-Strategien in der verarbeitenden
   Industrie standort \& uuml;bergreifend beeinflussen.},

Title = {Risk identification techniques for international contracting projects by

Abstract = {Globally, managing political risk is an essential component of
   international contracting and project management. Due to political
   unpredictability and volatility in most nations, there could be a
   substantial influence on the successful completion of any construction
   project. To mitigate this, contractors employ a systematic strategy for
   risk management, including expropriation, civil disturbance, and shifts
   in governmental policies taking into consideration all the political
   risks connected to global projects. As a result of the political
   volatility, there is a need for political risk management (PRM)
   approaches by the International Construction Corporation (ICC). This
   study investigates the risk identification techniques for international
   contracting professionals in the construction sector. The methodology
   for conducting this investigation is based on data collection through
   questionnaires from construction sector professionals in both academia
   and industry. The tools were used to develop essential components from
   the factors established. This was then analysed using quantitative
   techniques to examine identified risk factors and make study deductions.
   The findings of this study identified the crucial PRM-related
   implications for global initiatives and various risks that were
   considered in typical construction projects. The political environment
   should be thoroughly examined, prospective risks should be noted, and
   risk-reduction tactics should be included in this plan. Thus, a
   successful project is achievable when contractors can identify the
   risks, preserve their investments, minimize project delays, handle
   disruptions, and boost project success rates. Additionally, political
   risks are invariably associated with construction projects, and this is
   considered a concern for foreign contractors. Thus, good identification
   techniques will ensure project preparedness, which is required by
   expatriates and foreign contractors. This is necessary as they need to
   ensure that their projects are successfully handled and that there are
   alternative plans to handle any unexpected event on the project.},

Title = {Form and functioning: contextualising the start of the global financing
   facility policy processes in Burkina Faso},
Journal = {GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {17},

Abstract = {BackgroundBurkina Faso joined the Global Financing Facility for Women,
   Children and Adolescents (GFF) in 2017 to address persistent gaps in
   funding for reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent
   health and nutrition (RMNCAH-N). Few empirical papers deal with how
   global funding mechanisms, and specifically GFF, support resource
   mobilisation for health nationally. ObjectiveThis study describes the
   policy processes of developing the GFF planning documents (the
   Investment Case and Project Appraisal Document) in Burkina Faso.
   MethodsWe conducted an exploratory qualitative policy analysis. Data
   collection included document review (N = 74) and in-depth
   semi-structured interviews (N = 23). Data were analysed based on the
   components of the health policy triangle. ResultsThere was strong
   national political support to RMNCAH-N interventions, and the process of
   drawing up the investment case (IC) and the project appraisal document
   was inclusive and multi-sectoral. Despite high-level policy commitments,
   subsequent implementation of the World Bank project, including the GFF
   contribution, was perceived by respondents as challenging, even after
   the project restructuring process occurred. These challenges were due to
   ongoing policy fragmentation for RMNCAH-N, navigation of differing
   procedures and perspectives between stakeholders in the setting up of
   the work, overcoming misunderstandings about the nature of the GFF, and
   weak institutional anchoring of the IC. Insecurity and political
   instability also contributed to observed delays and difficulties in
   implementing the commitments agreed upon. To tackle these issues,
   transformational and distributive leaderships should be promoted and
   made effective. ConclusionsFew studies have examined national policy
   processes linked to the GFF or other global health initiatives. This
   kind of research is needed to better understand the range of challenges
   in aligning donor and national priorities encountered across diverse
   health systems contexts. This study may stimulate others to ensure that
   the GFF and other global health initiatives respond to local needs and
   policy environments for better implementation.},

Abstract = {This paper examines how social movements influenced Greece's
   macroeconomic adjustment during the financial crisis and austerity
   period (2010-2015). The purpose is to identify the channels through
   which mobilizations-anti-austerity protests, general strikes, youth
   actions, and solidarity networks-interacted with the economy. The main
   hypothesis is that social protest operates as an economic force via
   three mechanisms: expectations (shifts in household and firm beliefs
   affecting consumption, confidence, and investment), disruption
   (coordination and operating costs from strikes and stoppages affecting
   output and employment), and institutional feedback (policy sequencing
   and credibility under EU-IMF conditionality shaping behavior). Using a
   theoretical, literature-based methodology-a structured narrative review
   of peer-reviewed studies, policy documents, and historical syntheses-we
   map these mechanisms onto outcomes (GDP, unemployment, investment,
   consumer confidence). The findings support the hypothesis: expectations
   and feedback dominate the transmission to investment and confidence,
   while repeated disruption is most salient for labor-market dynamics;
   solidarity infrastructures cushion social costs but have ambiguous
   aggregate effects. The scope is interpretive and Greece-specific,
   yielding testable propositions for future causal work. Limitations
   follow from the design: the study does not estimate effect sizes or
   establish causality; conclusions are analytically persuasive rather than
   statistically demonstrative. The contribution is a mechanism map that
   integrates social-movement theory with crisis political economy and
   clarifies where empirical identification should focus.},

Abstract = {In the dynamic context of modern business, the role of religion in
   business management is increasingly attracting the attention of
   researchers and practitioners. Religion, seen as a set of spiritual
   beliefs and practices, deeply shapes people's values, behaviors, and
   decisions, thus impacting the way organizations are managed. Using
   bibliometric analysis allowed us to identify research trends, the links
   between the keywords underlying the selected studies, and the impact of
   the publications on the business environment. The study revealed that
   religious values can shape ethical behavior, leadership styles, and
   corporate social responsibility in business. Most studies focus on the
   influences of Islamic, Catholic, and Protestant religions, leaving a
   significant gap in understanding how orthodox values and practices
   influence organizational behavior and business ethics, even though this
   is the dominant religion in many Eastern and South-Eastern European
   countries. For a more comprehensive perspective, future research should
   include case studies and surveys in these geographical and cultural
   regions, combining qualitative and quantitative methods of data
   analysis. This study provides a robust basis for future research,
   stimulating reflection on how religious values can shape the business
   landscape in the 21st century.},

Title = {The unequal spirit of the Protestant Reformation: particularism and
   wealth distribution in early modern Germany},

Abstract = {This paper assesses the impact of the Protestant Reformation on wealth
   distribution and inequality in confessionally divided Germany, between
   1400 and 1800. The Reformation expanded social welfare, but provided it
   in a particularistic way to ``deserving{''} poor and natives only. This
   gave Protestantism an ambiguous character in terms of redistribution and
   its impact on inequality. I develop a theoretical framework of this
   trade-off between welfare expansion and particularistic provision, and
   test its implications empirically, using a difference-in-differences and
   an instrumental variable strategy. In line with the theoretical
   framework, the analysis documents that the Reformation exacerbated
   inequality overall by making marginal poor people relatively poorer.
   This increase in inequality was driven by the introduction of new
   particularistic poor relief policies in Protestant communities. Economic
   growth was unlikely to be large enough to compensate poor strata for
   their losses. Protestantism emerges as an underappreciated driver of
   preindustrial inequality, long before the onset of industrialisation and
   modern economic growth.},

Title = {`No manner of hurt was found upon him'. The role of religiousness in the
   mental health effect of job insecurity},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE \& MEDICINE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {364},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This study examines how religiousness moderates the mental health effect
   of job insecurity, a prevalent stressor in modern societies. We use
   panel data from a representative, large sample of Dutch employees from
   2008 to 2018. Exploiting the longitudinal nature of the data, we control
   for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity. Our main results indicate
   that job insecurity negatively affects men's but not women's mental
   health. Religious employees, however, are shielded from the adverse
   mental health effects of job insecurity. The protective effect of
   religiousness seems to be different for Catholics and Protestants:
   Protestant employees are shielded from the adverse mental health effects
   of job insecurity, whereas Catholic employees are not. Differences in
   work ethic and social network that religiousness may provide cannot
   explain the protective effect of religiousness. The mechanism at work
   appears to be a firm belief in God, as well as belief in life after
   death, in particular in combination with frequent attendance of
   religious gatherings or daily prayer. Unlike belief in God's existence,
   which shields only the religious, belief in life after death shields the
   religious and non-religious alike. The confluence of increasing job
   insecurity and increasing secularisation poses a risk to public mental
   health. Our results contribute to identifying employees who are
   particularly at risk and could, by shedding light on the mechanisms,
   suggest directions for potential preventive and curative interventions.},

Abstract = {This article investigates burnout among lawyers and proposes systemic
   changes to reduce pressure and stress in the legal profession while
   enhancing resilience among lawyers. The article focuses on factors
   influencing career continuity among Palestinian lawyers within a
   socio-politically complex environment. It discusses elements
   contributing to resilience, including a positive mindset, a strong
   support system, training, and social support. The study reveals
   exceptional resilience among Palestinian lawyers. A quantitative
   cross-sectional study was used; the goals of the study involved 323
   participants from different places in Palestine. Data analysis employed
   Smart PLS4 to build a regression model. Challenging conventional
   notions, the study provides valuable insights for state strategies,
   legal firms, educational institutions, and policymakers to address
   challenges and improve lawyer retention and job satisfaction in an
   environment marked by unstable economic and political conditions.
   Additionally, it examines gender-specific career intentions, notably
   women lawyers displaying a stronger inclination to stay, potentially
   linked to socio-economic responsibilities. This study contributes
   significantly to existing literature by providing a unique case study on
   career continuance determinants within economic and political
   instability. It sets a precedent for further study and strategic
   improvements in lawyer retention and job satisfaction within high-stress
   professions in an economically and politically complex environment.},

Abstract = {Socio-political risks (SPRs) are important drivers of firm-level risk.
   Beyond unexpected variation in socio-political environments over time,
   the difference between home and host country sociopolitical contexts
   induces risk as it increases the difficulty to understand a foreign
   environment. This risk is specifically important for internationally
   active firms, as they need to gather and interpret information stemming
   from different socio-political environments to manage their
   international operations. However, existing literature lacks both
   concept and measure to capture such information asymmetry. In this
   paper, we explain how cross-national distance is related to SPRs through
   information asymmetry, and develop a reflective measure of
   cross-national distance based on information theory, signal analysis,
   and financial market information. Conceptual and empirical evaluations
   and applications of the concept and measure proposed provide support for
   our approach.},

Title = {Do Board Characteristics Affect Non-Performing Loans? GCC vs. Non-GCC
   Insights},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL STUDIES},

Abstract = {The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region has faced challenges like
   political instability and economic fluctuations, which have impacted
   non-performing loans (NPL) levels. At the same time, over the years,
   reforms and regulations have encouraged stronger board structures to
   enhance corporate governance and improve risk management. The purpose of
   this paper is to investigate how board characteristics affect
   non-performing in the MENA region. Board characteristics shape
   governance quality, which influences risk management and reduces banks'
   risk-taking behaviours. Hence, effective governance can reduce
   non-performing loans by improving oversight and credit decisions. To
   this end, we used a sample of 70 banks operating in 12 countries in the
   MENA region from 2010 to 2022. The System Generalized Method of Moments
   (SGMM) was employed as an empirical technique. To benefit from a
   comparative analysis, we divided the entire sample into two subsamples.
   The first subsample covers six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries
   with 42 banks. The second subsample is also relative to six non-Gulf
   Cooperation Council (non-GCC) countries with 28 banks. The empirical
   findings indicate that the presence of independent board members, a
   higher number of female board members, board remuneration, and the board
   index decrease NPLs across all regions, including MENA, GCC, and
   non-GCC. However, we found that board size, tenure, and duality increase
   NPLs. The results of this paper are beneficial for both policymakers and
   bankers, as they provide insights into how governance through board
   characteristics influences credit risk. These results support better
   decision-making in board appointments and governance practices to
   improve risk management and reduce non-performing loans.},

Title = {Stability of international joint ventures: When experience and age
   overshadow host country risk},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {30},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This study examines how host country risk affects the stability of
   international joint ventures (IJVs). Besides, it examines the moderating
   impact of experience in the host country and age of the IJV on the
   association between country risk and IJV stability. We use transaction
   cost economics (TCE) to hypothesize a detrimental impact of host country
   risk and IJV stability. Additionally, we integrate TCE and
   knowledge-based theory (KBT) to develop the hypotheses suggesting that
   the negative association between country risk and IJV stability is
   moderated by experience in the IJV's host country and the age of the
   IJV. Using a dataset on 140 IJVs established between French and
   cross-border partners, and employing event history analysis to assess
   IJV stability over time, we find that host country risk has a
   detrimental impact on IJV stability. Furthermore, we find that the
   degree of experience possession in IJV's host country and the age of the
   IJV moderate the negative association between host country risk and IJV
   stability.},

Abstract = {Research on political parties and social movements has long developed
   independently, separated by the disciplinary boundaries of political
   science and sociology. We see the recent successes of `movement parties'
   as a push to bridge the two disciplinary traditions in order to describe
   this new hybrid party type accurately. To this end, we ask to what
   extent and under what conditions do we observe movement parties in
   European party systems, and how can we define the various subtypes? In
   the introduction to the special issue, we make three contributions.
   First, we identify existing definitions and empirical examples in the
   study of movement parties based on a systematic review of the emerging
   literature. Second, we operationalize Herbert Kitschelt's influential
   definition of lower levels of programmatic and organizational investment
   coupled with a higher degree of protest mobilization. Third, we
   introduce the individual contributions to the special issue and situate
   them within the relevant theoretical debates. Utilizing a new set of
   quantitative indicators, we empirically assess how parties identified as
   movement parties in the existing literature score on programmatic,
   organizational, and protest dimensions. The analysis underscores the
   heterogeneity of movement parties, with only a few cases aligning with
   Kitschelt's comprehensive definition.},

Title = {Pensions and protestants: or why everything in retirement can't be
   optimized},
Journal = {ANNALS OF ACTUARIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 4},
Abstract = {A common narrative among insurance actuaries and business economists is
   that national or regional pension systems can be finetuned, optimized,
   and improved simply by tinkering with demographic and financial
   parameters; all within the context of the ``right{''} mathematical
   model. Indeed, recent papers in the actuarial literature have offered
   technical fixes around savings rates, retirement ages, decumulation
   strategies as well as more refined mortality and interest rate models.
   But alas, not everything in the world of pensions and retirement can be
   optimized, in particular as it relates to the history, background
   culture, or religion of the underlying population. This paper documents
   a statistically significant relationship between a region's pension plan
   ``health status{''} and the fraction of the region's population
   identifying as Protestant Christians (PC). We begin the analysis at the
   national level using a well-known pension quality index and then obtain
   similar results for the actuarial funded status of U.S. state pension
   plans. Overall, this work is within the sphere of recent literature that
   indicates historical religious beliefs, values, and culture matter for
   financial economic outcomes; a factor which obviously can't be optimized
   within a mathematical Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. In other
   words, some things in retirement are truly beyond control.},

Journal = {COMMUNICATION AND THE PUBLIC},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 25},
Abstract = {Online engagement is key to sustaining online connective action over
   time. However, there is limited research on how social media messages
   can trigger diverse connective actions, quantifying more precisely the
   different forms of online engagement generated with social protest,
   especially those related with environment and climate change. To this
   end, this study analyses a random sample of tweets containing
   \#fridaysforfuture to identify which message characteristics motivate
   people to engage online in the digitally networked action against
   climate change. Results evidence that depends on who send messages
   (Greta Thunberg and icon-influencers), what content ({''}not supporting
   the movement{''} and ``information about COVID-19 and digital
   strikes{''}), when (during business hours), and how (audiovisual format
   and other hashtags), higher levels of online engagement with
   \#fridaysforfuture are generated via retweets, cited tweets, likes,
   comments, and replies to comments. This study contributes to previous
   literature expanding the empirical applications of the connective action
   theory, using a broader and deeper metric of online engagement with
   social movements, and providing a bigger picture on the debate on the
   importance of message strategies to generate higher engagement with
   social protest. This research offers implications to optimize message
   design, fine-tune communication strategy in general, and, in the case of
   social movements, to reinforce digitally networked action.},

Title = {Evaluating the value of lost load to South Korea's residential
   electricity consumers by stated and revealed preference methods},
Journal = {UTILITIES POLICY},

Abstract = {This study estimates the value of lost load (VoLL) for the residential
   sector in South Korea, where an isolated electricity system and the
   rapid growth of renewable energy sources increase the risk of blackouts.
   We provide benchmark outage cost estimates using two complementary
   approaches based on stated preferences (the contingent valuation method,
   CVM) and revealed preferences (the leisure cost method, LCM). The CVM
   VoLL is 3,564 KRW/kWh (2.76 USD/kWh), reflecting households' willingness
   to pay to prevent a 1-h outage. In contrast, the LCM VoLL is 7,473
   KRW/kWh (5.78 USD/kWh), representing the opportunity cost of lost
   leisure. A robustness check applying a two-step classification of
   protest responses yields 4,857 KRW/kWh (3.76 USD/kWh), narrowing the gap
   with international benchmarks. The relatively low CVM VoLL reflects the
   public-good perception of electricity in South Korea, where Korea
   Electric Power Corporation, a public utility, supplies power under
   regulated tariffs. By contrast, the higher LCM VoLL highlights the
   implicit economic value of reliability. Distinguishing protest zeros in
   stated-preference surveys is therefore critical for accurate estimation.
   Taken together, these results demonstrate the importance of integrating
   robust VoLL estimates into electricity market reforms. In the short
   term, they provide empirical support for addressing the public utility's
   financial deficit caused by regulated tariffs. In the long term, they
   can guide the development of capacity and ancillary service markets, and
   help address the ``missing money{''} problem associated with energy
   transitions. Beyond Korea, the findings offer insights for other
   countries with isolated grids or strong public-sector governance,
   contributing to more reliable and equitable electricity market design.},

Abstract = {How do states maintain economic development in the face of sanctions?
   Recent studies have examined economic resilience as a property of a
   system preceding a shock, leaving unanswered questions about how
   sanctioned states discipline employers and limit predatory behaviour.
   Using the case of Iran, this article aims to fill this gap by presenting
   a model of mobilized resilience, describing how bottom-up and top-down
   mobilizations can create demand for institutional capacity. Integrating
   unique qualitative and quantitative material, the author argues that
   Iran's political elites responded to sanctions by launching top-down
   campaigns that appealed to workers, promoted capital-labour unity, and
   demanded state commitment to development. These campaigns facilitated
   widespread labour protests that further empowered the state to block
   capital flight and steer firms onto more profitable, growth-oriented
   routes. Labour `resistance' thus unexpectedly helped to realize the
   Supreme Leader's calls for a `resistance economy'. These findings
   suggest that political support for worker mobilization in the context of
   sanctions can result in economic benefits, with significant consequences
   for our understanding of economic statecraft, development and labour
   movements.},

   consumer social responsibility, green advertising, and green consumer
   trust matter for sustainable development?},

Abstract = {Generation Z (Gen-Z), representing a demographic cohort of persons born
   from 1995 to 2010, has demonstrated their concerns for environmental
   protection. On September 20, 2019, for example, millions of Gen-Zs from
   over 150 different countries across the globe embarked on a protest to
   pressure decision-makers and governments to help save the planet. Such
   campaigns have caused firms to rethink how they operate by adopting
   green operations in their production and distribution of products. The
   footwear industry is not left out. The problem this research sought to
   address is the assessment of the effect of green consumer knowledge on
   green purchase behavior among Gen-Z consumers towards footwear while
   assessing the roles of consumer social responsibility, green
   advertising, and green consumer trust. The study was quantitative in
   nature and used an online questionnaire to survey 559 Chinese Gen-Z
   consumers. Findings revealed that although green consumer knowledge had
   a direct effect on green purchase behavior, this effect was partially
   mediated by consumer social responsibility. The effect of consumer
   social responsibility on green purchase behavior was positively
   moderated by green advertising, and the moderating effect of green
   advertising was further strengthened by green consumer trust. Finally,
   the mediating effect of consumer social responsibility was conditional
   on the moderating effects of green advertising and green consumer trust.
   It was concluded that green consumer knowledge is an essential
   ingredient in enhancing Gen-Z consumers' green purchase behavior towards
   footwear, as such, advocacy and pressure groups must increasingly
   conscientize consumers.},
